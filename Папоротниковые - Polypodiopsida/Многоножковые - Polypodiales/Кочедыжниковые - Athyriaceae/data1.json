In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the family is placed in the suborder Aspleniineae, and includes two genera. Alternatively, it may be treated as the subfamily Athyrioideae of a very broadly defined family Aspleniaceae. The family has with a cosmopolitan distribution.\nSpecies of the Athyriaceae are terrestrial or lithophytic, less commonly aquatic. They grow from various kinds of rhizome: short or long, creeping or erect, branched or not. The distribution and evolution of characters in the family is complex, and the genera have few constant features by which they can be identified. The sporangia have stalks two or three cells wide in the middle, and contain brown monolete spores.","dates":{"added":1657302989,"dateRange":{"0":1624198641,"1":1656766739}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:50:20.610Z"}

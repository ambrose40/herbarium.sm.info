The group is commonly known as the \"pepperwort family\" or as the \"water-clover family\" because the leaves of the genus Marsilea superficially resemble the leaves of a four-leaf clover (a flowering plant). In all, the family contains 3 genera and 50 to 80 species with most of those belonging to Marsilea.\nMembers of the Marsileaceae are aquatic or semi-aquatic. Plants often grow in dense clumps in mud along the shores of ponds or streams, or they may grow submerged in shallow water with some of the leaves extending to float on the water surface. They grow in seasonally wet habitats, but survive the winter or dry season by losing their leaves and producing hard, desiccation-resistant reproductive structures.","dates":{"added":1653173234,"dateRange":{"0":1652954880,"1":1652954955}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:50:21.111Z","title":"Марсилиевые - Marsileaceae"}

The group is commonly known as the \"pepperwort family\" or as the \"water-clover family\" because the leaves of the genus Marsilea superficially resemble the leaves of a four-leaf clover (a flowering plant). In all, the family contains 3 genera and 50 to 80 species with most of those belonging to Marsilea.\nMembers of the Marsileaceae are aquatic or semi-aquatic. Plants often grow in dense clumps in mud along the shores of ponds or streams, or they may grow submerged in shallow water with some of the leaves extending to float on the water surface. They grow in seasonally wet habitats, but survive the winter or dry season by losing their leaves and producing hard, desiccation-resistant reproductive structures.","dates":{"added":1653173234,"dateRange":{"0":1652954880,"1":1652954955}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:50:21.111Z","category":"folder","title":"Марсилиевые - Marsileaceae"}],"name":"Сальвиниевые - Salviniales","comment":"The order Salviniales (formerly known as the Hydropteridales and including the former Marsileales) is an order of ferns in the class Polypodiopsida.\nSalviniales are all aquatic and differ from all other ferns in being heterosporous, meaning that they produce two different types of spores (megaspores and microspores) that develop into two different types of gametophytes (female and male gametophytes, respectively), and in that their gametophytes are endosporic, meaning that they never grow outside the spore wall and cannot become larger than the spores that produced them. The megasporangia each produce a single megaspore.[1] In being heterosporus with endosporic gametophytes they are more similar to seed plants than to other ferns.\nThe fertile and sterile leaves are dimorphic, taking on a different shape, and leaves bear anastomosing veins. Aerenchyma is frequently present in roots, shoots, and petioles (leaf stalks).\nThe ferns of this order vary radically in form and do not look particularly fern-like. Species of the family Salviniaceae are natant (floating), while those of the family Marsileaceae are rooted. However, the natant species may temporarily grow on wet mud during times of low water, and the Marsileaceae may grow as emergent species, depending on species and location.\nThe group has also the smallest known genomes of all ferns. One genus, Azolla, is amongst the fastest growing plants on earth and caused a cooling of the climate in the Azolla event about 50 million years ago.","dates":{"added":1653173234,"dateRange":{"0":1640085985,"1":1652954955}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:40:06.688Z","title":"\\Сальвиниевые - Salviniales"}

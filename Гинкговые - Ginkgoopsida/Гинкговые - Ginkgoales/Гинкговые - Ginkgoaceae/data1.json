Formerly, however, there were several other genera, and forests of ginkgo existed. Because leaves can take such diverse forms within a single species, these are a poor measure of diversity, although differing structures of wood point to the existence of diverse ginkgo forests in ancient times.","dates":{"added":1683998744,"dateRange":{"0":1469455998,"1":1682928920}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:46:38.180Z"}

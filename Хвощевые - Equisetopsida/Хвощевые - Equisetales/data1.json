Pseudobornia is the oldest known relative of Equisetum; it grew in the late Devonian, about 375 million years ago and is assigned to its own order.\nAll living horsetails are placed in the genus Equisetum. But there are some fossil species that are not assignable to the modern genus. Equisetites is a \"wastebin taxon\" uniting all sorts of large horsetails from the Mesozoic; it is almost certainly paraphyletic and would probably warrant being subsumed in Equisetum. But while some of the species placed there are likely to be ancestral to the modern horsetails, there have been reports of secondary growth in other Equisetites, and these probably represent a distinct and now-extinct horsetail lineage. Equicalastrobus is the name given to fossil horsetail strobili, which probably mostly or completely belong to the (sterile) plants placed in Equisetites.","dates":{"added":1652035499,"dateRange":{"0":1241730770,"1":1652019654}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:51:28.35Z","category":"folder","title":"Хвощёвые - Equisetaceae"}],"name":"Хвощевые - Equisetales","comment":"Equisetales is an order of Equisetopsida, with only one living family, the Equisetaceae, containing the genus Equisetum (horsetails).\nIn the molecular phylogenetic classification of Smith et al. in 2006, Equisetales, in its present circumscription, was held to be the sole member of class Equisetopsida. The linear sequence of Christenhusz et al. (2011), intended for compatibility with the classification of Chase and Reveal (2009) which placed all land plants in Equisetopsida, made it the sole member of subclass Equisetidae, equivalent to Smith's Equisetopsida. The placement of Equisetales in subclass Equisetidae has subsequently been followed in the classifications of Christenhusz and Chase (2014) and PPG I (2016).\nThe fossil record includes additional extinct species in Equisetaceae and the extinct families Calamitaceae, Archaeocalamitaceae and Phyllothecaceae.","dates":{"added":1652035499,"dateRange":{"0":1241730770,"1":1652019654}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:40:24.612Z","title":"Хвощёвые - Equisetales"}

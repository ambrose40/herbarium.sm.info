This family has been recognized by almost all taxonomists, and is sometimes called the \"plane-tree family\". The family consists of only a single extant genus Platanus, with eight known species. The plants are tall trees, native to temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The hybrid London plane is widely planted in cities worldwide.\nThe plane-tree is referenced in Pliny the Younger's letter to Domitius Apollinaris as part of his description of his Tuscan Villa located somewhere in Tuscany in the first century.","dates":{"added":1684089824,"dateRange":{"0":1304507040,"1":1682849963}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.499Z"}

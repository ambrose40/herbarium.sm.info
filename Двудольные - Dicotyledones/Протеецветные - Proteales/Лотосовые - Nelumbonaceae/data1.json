The APG IV system of 2016 (unchanged from the earlier APG system of 1998, the APG II system of 2003 and the APG III system of 2009) places the family in the order Proteales, in the clade eudicots.\nThe family consists of aquatic plants, extant Nelumbo are native to North America and Asia (and perhaps some adjacent areas, but widely cultivated). At least four other genera, Nelumbites, Exnelumbites, Paleonelumbo, and Nelumbago, are known from fossils.\nThe Cronquist system, of 1981, also recognized this family, but placed it in order Nymphaeales in subclass Magnoliidae in class Magnoliopsida (=dicotyledons), based on gross morphological similarities. The Dahlgren system and Thorne system (1992) also recognized this family and placed it in its own order Nelumbonales in superorder Magnolianae in subclass Magnoliidae (=dicotyledons).","dates":{"added":1422822598,"dateRange":{"0":1355818850,"1":1421413650}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.499Z"}

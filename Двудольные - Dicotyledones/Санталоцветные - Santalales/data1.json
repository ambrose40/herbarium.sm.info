In this circumscription, the family includes the several genera of mistletoes. This family name is currently being studied and under review as in past decades, several systems of plant taxonomy recognized this family, notably the 1981 Cronquist system.\nHowever, the APG II system of 2003 does not recognize the family, treating it as a synonym of Santalaceae. This did not end the taxonomic debate among botanists and there are many that still think Viscaceae should be an accepted family name. According to the APG IV system Der and Nickrent (2008) found seven well supported clades in Santalaceae, but relationships between these clades are still poorly understood.","dates":{"added":1683410765,"dateRange":{"0":1557814675,"1":1683104612}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.499Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Санталоцветные - Santalales","comment":"The Santalales are an order of flowering plants with a cosmopolitan distribution, but heavily concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions. It derives its name from its type genus Santalum (sandalwood). Mistletoe is the common name for a number of parasitic plants within the order.\nMany of the members of the order are parasitic plants, mostly hemiparasites, able to produce sugars through photosynthesis, but tapping the stems or roots of other plants to obtain water and minerals; some (e.g. Arceuthobium) are obligate parasites, have low concentrations of chlorophyll within their shoots (1\/5 to 1\/10 of that found in their host\u2019s foliage), and derive the majority of their sustenance from their hosts' vascular tissues (water, micro- and macronutrients, and sucrose).\nMost have seeds without testae (seed coats), which is unusual for flowering plants.","dates":{"added":1683410765,"dateRange":{"0":1557814675,"1":1683104612}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.935Z"}

Members of the family are widely distributed throughout the north temperate zone, and have a scattered distribution elsewhere except for Australasia.\nThe family was formerly sometimes treated to include the hackberries, (Celtis and allies), but analysis by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group members suggests that these genera are better placed in the related family Cannabaceae. The circumscription included in the taxobox is the one suggested by P. Stevens on his Missouri Botanical Garden Angiosperm Phylogeny Website and includes information from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Vascular Plant Families and Genera list. It generally is considered to include ca 7 genera and about 45 species. Some classifications also include the genus Ampelocera.\nThe family is a group of evergreen or deciduous trees and shrubs with mucilagenous substances in leaf and bark tissue. Leaves are usually alternate on the stems. The leaf blades are simple (not compound), with entire (smooth) or variously toothed margins, and often have an asymmetrical base. The flowers are small and either bisexual or unisexual. The fruit is an indehiscent samara, nut, or drupe. Ulmus provides important timber trees mostly for furniture, and U. rubra, the slippery elm, is a medicinal plant known for the demulcent property of its inner bark. Planera aquatica is also a timber species. Planera, Ulmus, and Zelkova are all grown as ornamental trees.","dates":{"added":1652624619,"dateRange":{"0":1274432987,"1":1652530930}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.499Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Cannabaceae","deepCounters":{"total":74,"images":68,"folders":6,"files":68},"counters":{"total":6,"folders":6},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Cannabaceae\/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BB%D1%8F%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Cannabis%20sativa\/thumbs\/DSC02641.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Коноплёвые - Cannabaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Cannabaceae is a small family of flowering plants.

As now circumscribed, the family includes about 170 species grouped in about 11 genera, including Cannabis (hemp, marijuana), Humulus (hops) and Celtis (hackberries). Celtis is by far the largest genus, containing about 100 species.\nOther than a shared evolutionary origin, members of the family have few common characteristics; some are trees (e.g. Celtis), others are herbaceous plants (e.g. Cannabis).\nMembers of this family can be trees (e.g. Celtis), erect herbs (e.g. Cannabis), or twining herbs (e.g. Humulus).\nLeaves are often more or less palmately lobed or palmately compound and always bear stipules. Cystoliths are always present and some members of this family possess laticifers.\nCannabaceae are often dioecious (distinct male and female plants). The flowers are actinomorphic (radially symmetrical) and not showy, as these plants are pollinated by the wind. As an adaptation to this kind of pollination, the calyx is short and there is no corolla. Flowers are grouped to form cymes. In the dioecious plants the masculine inflorescences are long and look like panicles, while the feminine are shorter and bear fewer flowers. The pistil is made of two connate carpels, the usually superior ovary is unilocular; there is no fixed number of stamens.\nThe fruit can be an achene or a drupe.","dates":{"added":1661691515,"dateRange":{"0":1315665775,"1":1661608111}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.530Z","category":"folder","title":"Коноплёвые - Cannabaceae"},{"path":"%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Urticaceae","deepCounters":{"total":135,"images":126,"folders":9,"files":126},"counters":{"total":9,"folders":9},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Urticaceae\/%D0%9A%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%20%D0%B4%D0%B2%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Urtica%20dioica\/thumbs\/DSC00068.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Крапивные - Urticaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Urticaceae are a family, the nettle family, of flowering plants.

The largest genera are Pilea (500 to 715 species), Elatostema (300 species), Urtica (80 species), and Cecropia (75 species). Cecropia contains many myrmecophytes.\nUrticaceae species can be found worldwide, apart from the polar regions.\nUrticaceae species can be shrubs (e.g. Pilea), lianas, herbs (e.g. Urtica, Parietaria), or, rarely, trees (Dendrocnide, Cecropia). Their leaves are usually entire and bear stipules. Urticating (stinging) hairs are often present. They have usually unisexual flowers and can be both monoecious or dioecious.

Rhamnaceae is included in the order Rosales.\nThe family contains about 55 genera and 950 species. The Rhamnaceae have a worldwide distribution, but are more common in the subtropical and tropical regions. The earliest fossil evidence of Rhamnaceae is from the Late Cretaceous. Fossil flowers have been collected from the Upper Cretaceous of Mexico and the Paleocene of Argentina.\nLeaves of Rhamnaceae family members are simple, i.e., the leaf blades are not divided into smaller leaflets. Leaves can be either alternate and spiraling, or opposite. Stipules are present. These leaves are modified into spines in many genera, in some (e.g. Paliurus spina-christi and Colletia cruciata) spectacularly so. Colletia stands out by having two axillary buds instead of one, one developing into a thorn, the other one into a shoot.\nThe flowers are radially symmetrical. There are 5 (sometimes 4) separate sepals and 5 (sometimes 4 or none) separate petals. The petals may be white, yellowish, greenish, pink or blue, and are small and inconspicuous in most genera, though in some (e.g. Ceanothus) the dense clusters of flowers are conspicuous. The 5 or 4 stamens are opposite the petals. The ovary is superior, with 2 or 3 ovules (or one by abortion).\nThe fruits are mostly berries, fleshy drupes, or nuts. Some are adapted to wind carriage, but most are dispersed by mammals and birds. Chinese jujube is the fruit of the jujube tree (Ziziphus zizyphus) and is a major fruit in China.\nThe American genus Ceanothus, which has several showy ornamental species, has nitrogen-fixing root nodules.\nEconomic uses of the Rhamnaceae are chiefly as ornamental plants and as the source of many brilliant green and yellow dyes. The wood of Rhamnus was also the most favoured species to make charcoal for use in gunpowder before the development of modern propellants.","dates":{"added":1658512136,"dateRange":{"0":1251461630,"1":1658237528}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.545Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Elaeagnaceae","deepCounters":{"total":85,"images":80,"folders":5,"files":80},"counters":{"total":5,"folders":5},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Elaeagnaceae\/%D0%9B%D0%BE%D1%85%20%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Elaeagnus%20umbellata\/thumbs\/0DSC06127.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Лоховые - Elaeagnaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Elaeagnaceae are a plant family, the oleaster family, of the order Rosales comprising small trees and shrubs, native to temperate regions of the Northern&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Лоховые - Elaeagnaceae","comment":"The Elaeagnaceae are a plant family, the oleaster family, of the order Rosales comprising small trees and shrubs, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, south into tropical Asia and Australia.

The family includes well-known plants such as the fig, banyan, breadfruit, mulberry, and Osage-orange.

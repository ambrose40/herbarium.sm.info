Flowers are actinomorphic and bisexual with fused sepals and petals. The stamens are attached to the inside of the petals (epipetalous) and alternate with the corolla lobes. There is a glandular disk at the base of the gynoecium, and flowers have parietal placentation. The inflorescence is cymose, with simple or complex cymes. The fruits are dehiscent septicidal capsules splitting into two halves, rarely some species have a berry. Seeds are small with copiously oily endosperms and a straight embryo. The habit varies from small trees, pachycaul shrubs to (usually) herbs, with ascending, erect or twining stems. Plants are usually rhizomatous. Leaves opposite, less often alternate or in some species whorled, simple in shape, with entire edges and bases connately attached to the stem. Stipules are absent. Plants usually accumulate bitter iridoid substances; bicollateral bundles are present. Ecologically, partial myco-heterotrophy is common among species in this family with a few genera such as Voyria and Voyriella lacking chlorophyll and being fully myco-heterotrophic.","dates":{"added":1654427320,"dateRange":{"0":1376477011,"1":1654352427}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.186Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Gelsemiaceae","deepCounters":{"total":5,"images":4,"folders":1,"files":4},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Gelsemiaceae\/%D0%93%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B8%20%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Gelsemium%20sempervirens\/thumbs\/DSC04682.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Гельземиевые - Gelsemiaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Gelsemiaceae is a family of flowering plants, belonging to the order Gentianales.

The family contains only three genera: Gelsemium, Mostuea and Pteleocarpa. Gelsemium has three species, one native to Southeast Asia and southern China and two native to Central America, Mexico, and the southeastern United States. The eight species of Mostuea are native to tropical areas of South America, Africa, and Madagascar. The two genera were formerly classified in the family Loganiaceae. Pteleocarpa was originally placed in Boraginaceae or in its own family Pteleocarpaceae, but it is most closely related to Gelsemiaceae with which it shares significant characters.\nThe family Gelsemiaceae was described in 1994. It is distinguished by having no latex or stipules and by having heterostylous flowers with yellow to white corollas and superior ovaries.\nIn 2014, a molecular phylogenetic study of the lamiids (aka Garryidae) resolved Gelsemiaceae as sister to the anomalous genus Pteleocarpa. The authors of that study believe that Gelsemiaceae should be expanded to include Pteleocarpa. The APG IV system published in 2016 includes Pteleocarpa in Gelsemiaceae.","dates":{"added":1422822598,"dateRange":{"0":1356063782,"1":1356063798}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.124Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Apocynaceae","deepCounters":{"total":397,"images":357,"folders":40,"files":357},"counters":{"total":40,"folders":40},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Apocynaceae\/%D0%9E%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Nerium%20oleander\/thumbs\/DSC02231.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Кутровые - Apocynaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Apocynaceae is a family of flowering plants that includes trees, shrubs, herbs, stem succulents, and vines, commonly called the dogbane family, after the&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Кутровые - Apocynaceae","comment":"Apocynaceae is a family of flowering plants that includes trees, shrubs, herbs, stem succulents, and vines, commonly called the dogbane family, after the American plant known as dogbane, Apocynum cannabinum. Members of the family are native to European, Asian, African, Australian, and American tropics or subtropics, with some temperate members. The family Asclepiadaceae (now known as Asclepiadoideae) is considered a subfamily of Apocynaceae and contains 348 genera.\nMany species are tall trees found in tropical rainforests, but some grow in tropical dry (xeric) environments. Also perennial herbs from temperate zones occur. Many of these plants have milky latex, and many species are poisonous if ingested. Some genera of Apocynaceae, such as Adenium, have milky latex apart from their sap, and others, such as Pachypodium, have clear sap and no latex.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1240754968,"1":1703339990}},"fileDate":"2023-12-25T13:29:49.794Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Rubiaceae","deepCounters":{"total":220,"images":200,"folders":20,"files":200},"counters":{"total":20,"folders":20},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Rubiaceae\/%D0%93%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Gardenia%20carinata\/thumbs\/DSC05629.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Мареновые - Rubiaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Rubiaceae are a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the coffee, madder, or bedstraw family.

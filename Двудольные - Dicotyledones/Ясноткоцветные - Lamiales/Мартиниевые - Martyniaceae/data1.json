The family was included in Pedaliaceae in the Cronquist system (under order Scrophulariales) but is recognized as a separate family by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group on the basis of phylogenetic studies that show that the two families are not closely related. Both families are characterized by having mucilaginous hairs \u2014 which give the stems and leaves a slimy or clammy feel \u2014 and fruits with hooks or horns. Some members of the genus Proboscidea are known as \"unicorn plant\" or \"devil's claw\" because of their horned seed capsules.","dates":{"added":1631400310,"dateRange":{"0":1631358952,"1":1631358982}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.670Z"}

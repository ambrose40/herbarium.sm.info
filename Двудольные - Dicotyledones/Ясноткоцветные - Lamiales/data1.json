Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs, such as basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and perilla. Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings. Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage, such as Coleus. Others are grown for seed, such as Salvia hispanica (chia), or for their edible tubers, such as Plectranthus edulis, Plectranthus esculentus, Plectranthus rotundifolius, and Stachys affinis (Chinese artichoke).\nThe family has a cosmopolitan distribution. The enlarged Lamiaceae contains about 236 genera and has been stated to contain 6,900 to 7,200 species, but the World Checklist lists 7,534. The largest genera are Salvia (900), Scutellaria (360), Stachys (300), Plectranthus (300), Hyptis (280), Teucrium (250), Vitex (250), Thymus (220), and Nepeta (200). Clerodendrum was once a genus of over 400 species, but by 2010, it had been narrowed to about 150.\nThe family has traditionally been considered closely related to the Verbenaceae; in the 1990s, phylogenetic studies suggested that many genera classified in the Verbenaceae should be classified in the Lamiaceae  or to other families in the order Lamiales.\nThe alternate family name Labiatae refers to the fact that the flowers typically have petals fused into an upper lip and a lower lip (labia in Latin). The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical with five united petals and five united sepals. They are usually bisexual and verticillastrate (a flower cluster that looks like a whorl of flowers, but actually consists of two crowded clusters). Although this is still considered an acceptable alternative name, most botanists now use the name Lamiaceae in referring to this family. The leaves emerge oppositely, each pair at right angles to the previous one (decussate) or whorled. The stems are frequently square in cross section, but this is not found in all members of the family, and is sometimes found in other plant families.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1240833426,"1":1703249595}},"fileDate":"2023-12-25T14:28:19.146Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%90%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Acanthaceae","deepCounters":{"total":187,"images":161,"folders":26,"files":161},"counters":{"total":26,"folders":26},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%90%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Acanthaceae\/%D0%9F%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B4%D1%8D%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BC%20%D0%B8%D0%B7%D1%8F%D1%89%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Pseuderanthemum%20graciflorum\/thumbs\/DSC05329.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Акантовые - Acanthaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Acanthaceae is a family (the acanthus family) of dicotyledonous flowering plants containing almost 250 genera and about 2500 species.

Most are tropical herbs, shrubs, or twining vines; some are epiphytes. Only a few species are distributed in temperate regions. The four main centres of distribution are Indonesia and Malaysia, Africa, Brazil, and Central America. The representatives of the family can be found in nearly every habitat, including dense or open forests, scrublands, wet fields and valleys, sea coast and marine areas, swamps, and mangrove forests.\nPlants in this family have simple, opposite, decussated leaves with entire (or sometimes toothed, lobed, or spiny) margins, and without stipules. The leaves may contain cystoliths, calcium carbonate concretions, seen as streaks on the surface.\nThe flowers are perfect, zygomorphic to nearly actinomorphic, and arranged in an inflorescence that is either a spike, raceme, or cyme. Typically, a colorful bract subtends each flower; in some species, the bract is large and showy. The calyx usually has four or five lobes; the corolla tubular, two-lipped or five-lobed; stamens number either two or four, arranged in pairs and inserted on the corolla, and the ovary is superior and bicarpellated, with axile placentation.\nThe fruit is a two-celled capsule, dehiscing somewhat explosively. In most species, the seeds are attached to a small, hooked stalk (a modified funiculus called a jaculator or a retinaculum) that ejects them from the capsule.\nA species well-known to temperate gardeners is bear's breeches (Acanthus mollis ), a herbaceous perennial plant with big leaves and flower spikes up to 2 m tall. Tropical genera familiar to gardeners include Thunbergia and Justicia.\nAvicennia, a genus of mangrove trees, usually placed in Verbenaceae or in its own family, Avicenniaceae, is included in Acanthaceae by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group on the basis of molecular phylogenetic studies that show it to be associated with this family.","dates":{"added":1658856652,"dateRange":{"0":1304424981,"1":1658739178}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.733Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%91%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Bignoniaceae","deepCounters":{"total":111,"images":100,"folders":11,"files":100},"counters":{"total":11,"folders":11},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%91%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Bignoniaceae\/%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%8F%20%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Spathodea%20campanulata\/thumbs\/DSC00098.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Бигнониевые - Bignoniaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Bignoniaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Lamiales commonly known as the bignonias.

It is not known to which of the other families in the order it is most closely related.\n\nNearly all of the Bignoniaceae are woody plants, but a few are subwoody, either as vines or subshrubs. A few more are herbaceous plants of high-elevation montane habitats, in three exclusively herbaceous genera: Tourrettia, Argylia, and Incarvillea. The family includes many lianas, climbing by tendrils, by twining, or rarely, by aerial roots. The largest tribe in the family, called Bignonieae, consists mostly of lianas and is noted for its unique wood anatomy.\n\nThe family has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, but is mostly tropical, with a few species native to the temperate zones. Its greatest diversity is in northern South America. The family has been covered in some major floristic projects, such as Flora of China, Flora Malesiana, and Flora Neotropica. It has not yet been covered in some others, such as Flora of Australia, and Flora of North America.\n\nBignoniaceae are most noted for ornamentals, such as Jacaranda, Tabebuia and Spathodea, grown for their conspicuous, tubular flowers. A great many species are known in cultivation. Various other uses have been made of members of this family. Several species were of great importance to the indigenous peoples of the American tropics. Fridericia elegans, Tanaecium bilabiata, and Tanaecium excitosum are poisonous to livestock and have caused severe losses.\n\nAccording to different accounts, the number of species in the family is about 810 or about 860. The last monograph of the entire family was published in 2004. In that work, 104 genera were recognized. Since that time, molecular phylogenetic studies have greatly clarified relationships within the family, and the number of accepted genera is now between 80 and 85.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1304676701,"1":1703253617}},"fileDate":"2023-12-25T15:05:22.919Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Verbenaceae","deepCounters":{"total":202,"images":186,"folders":16,"files":186},"counters":{"total":16,"folders":16},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Verbenaceae\/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%8F%20%D0%B2%D1%8C%D1%8E%D1%89%D0%B0%D1%8F%D1%81%D1%8F%20-%20Petrea%20volubilis\/thumbs\/0DSC07763.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Вербеновые - Verbenaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Verbenaceae  are a family, commonly known as the verbena family or vervain family, of mainly tropical flowering plants.

Many species have colorful and showy flowers and are cultivated as ornamental plants.\nMost species are perennial herbs or subshrubs but a few are woody shrubs or small trees. The phyllotaxy is usually opposite and decussate, but leaves have a spiral or alternate arrangement in some groups. As with other members of the Lamiales the flowers have a (usually) zygomorphic corolla whose petals are fused into a tube and there is no one character that separates a gesneriad from any other member of Lamiales. Gesneriads differ from related families of the Lamiales in having an unusual inflorescence structure, the \"pair-flowered cyme\", but some gesneriads lack this characteristic, and some other Lamiales (Calceolariaceae and some Scrophulariaceae) share it. The ovary can be superior, half-inferior or fully inferior, and the fruit a dry or fleshy capsule or a berry. The seeds are always small and numerous. Gesneriaceae have traditionally been separated from Scrophulariaceae by having a unilocular rather than bilocular ovary, with parietal rather than axile placentation.\nOn the basis of both morphological and biogeographical differences the family is divided into two major subfamilies: subfamily Cyrtandroideae in the Old World and subfamily Gesnerioideae in the New World. The biggest and most widespread genus is Cyrtandra, with about 600 species widely distributed in Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and the islands of the Pacific as far away as the Hawaiian Islands.\nSeveral molecular systematic studies have shown that Gesneriaceae are not closely related to any other family of the Lamiales, but more recently a sister-group relationship with Calceolariaceae has been suggested. Other studies have suggested that two genera generally placed in other families, Sanango and Peltanthera, are more closely related to Gesneriaceae than to any other members of the Lamiales but there is as yet no consensus on whether those genera should be included in the family.","dates":{"added":1653173231,"dateRange":{"0":1333796373,"1":1652956251}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.655Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%97%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Orobanchaceae","deepCounters":{"total":270,"images":254,"folders":16,"files":254},"counters":{"total":16,"folders":16},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%97%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Orobanchaceae\/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%20%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%20%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%88%D1%83%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Lathraea%20squamaria\/thumbs\/DSC08352.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Заразиховые - Orobanchaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Orobanchaceae, the broomrapes, is a family of parasitic plants of the order Lamiales, with about 90 genera and more than 2000 species.

Some members of the genus Proboscidea are known as \"unicorn plant\" or \"devil's claw\" because of their horned seed capsules.","dates":{"added":1631400310,"dateRange":{"0":1631358952,"1":1631358982}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.670Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Oleaceae","deepCounters":{"total":411,"images":386,"folders":25,"files":386},"counters":{"total":25,"folders":25},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Oleaceae\/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Olea%20europaea\/thumbs\/0BO303240.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Маслинные - Oleaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Oleaceae are a family of flowering plants in the order Lamiales.

The type genus is Plantago L..\nIn older classifications it used to be the only family of the order Plantaginales, but numerous phylogenetic studies, summarized by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, have demonstrated that this taxon should be included within Lamiales.\nThe plantain family as traditionally circumscribed consisted of only three genera, Bougueria, Littorella, and Plantago. However phylogenetic research has indicated that Plantaginaceae s.s. (s.s. = sensu stricto, in the strict sense) were nested within Scrophulariaceae (but forming a group that did not include the type genus of that family, Scrophularia). Although Veronicaceae (1782) is the oldest family name for this group, Plantaginaceae (1789) is a conserved name under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) and thus has priority over any earlier family name for a family including Plantago. Furthermore, the ICBN does not consider family names published before 1789 to be names eligible for conservation, thus ruling out Veronicaceae. The name Antirrhinaceae has been proposed for conservation over Plantaginaceae. In the meantime, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group has accepted the name Plantaginaceae. However, Olmstead (2003) has chosen to use the name Veronicaceae, a later synonym.\nPlantaginaceae s.l. (s.l. = sensu lato, in the broad sense) are a diverse, cosmopolitan family, occurring mostly in temperate zones. The group consists of herbs, shrubs and also a few aquatic plants with roots (such as the genus Callitriche). Being so diverse, the circumscription of this family is difficult to establish.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1211652033,"1":1703328057}},"fileDate":"2023-12-25T13:17:40.751Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8B%D1%80%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Lentibulariaceae","deepCounters":{"total":39,"images":35,"folders":4,"files":35},"counters":{"total":4,"folders":4},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8B%D1%80%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Lentibulariaceae\/%D0%9F%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8B%D1%80%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Utricularia%20vulgaris\/thumbs\/DSC01456.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Пузырчатковые - Lentibulariaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Lentibulariaceae, the bladderwort family, is a family of carnivorous plants containing three genera: Genlisea, the corkscrew plants; Pinguicula, the&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Пузырчатковые - Lentibulariaceae","comment":"Lentibulariaceae, the bladderwort family, is a family of carnivorous plants containing three genera: Genlisea, the corkscrew plants; Pinguicula, the butterworts; and Utricularia, the bladderworts.\nThe genera Polypompholyx (two species of pink petticoats or fairy aprons) and Biovularia used to be regarded as fourth and fifth members of this family. Biovularia has been subsumed into Utricularia, and Polypompholyx has been relegated to a subgenus of Utricularia. Placement of the family used to be in the Scrophulariales, which has been merged with Lamiales in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system.\nCarnivory in plants appears to have evolved independently in four major angiosperm lineages and five orders: Poales, Caryophyllales, Oxalidales, Ericales, and Lamiales.\nOne common trait found in several Lamiales families that may have led to carnivory is the secretion of proteinase mucilage through leaf surfaces. This mucilage is generally used to prevent insect predation by trapping and degrading potentially harmful insects. Some research suggests these glands can quite easily shift their function from secretion to absorption. This shift may have first occurred in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the Lentibulariaceae, introducing absorptive glands that provided additional macronutrients through trapped insects. The additional source of nutrients may have increased fitness of plants growing in low-nutrient habitats which eventually caused an embrace of carnivory. Further mapping of traits also suggests the MRCA was terrestrial and possessed a basal rosette composed of flat leaves and a primary root.","dates":{"added":1653173231,"dateRange":{"0":1277211232,"1":1652952915}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.780Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%A4%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Phrymaceae","deepCounters":{"total":17,"images":16,"folders":1,"files":16},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A4%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Phrymaceae\/%D0%93%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BF%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Mimulus%20guttatus\/thumbs\/DSC04508.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Фримовые - Phrymaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Phrymaceae, also known as the lopseed family, is a small family of flowering plants in the order Lamiales.

It has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, but is concentrated in two centers of diversity, one in Australia, the other in western North America. Members of this family occur in diverse habitats, including deserts, river banks and mountains.\nPhrymaceae is a family of mostly herbs and a few subshrubs, bearing tubular, bilaterally symmetric flowers. They can be annuals or perennials. Some of the Australian genera are aquatic or semiaquatic. One of these, Glossostigma, is among the smallest of flowering plants, larger than the aquatic Lemna but similar in size to the terrestrial Lepuropetalon. The smallest members of Phrymaceae are only a few centimeters long, while the largest are woody shrubs to 4 m tall. The floral structure of Phrymaceae is variable, to such an extent that a morphological assessment is difficult. Reproduction is also variable, being brought about by different mating systems which may be sexual or asexual, and may involve outcrossing, self-fertilization, or mixed mating. Some are pollinated by insects, others by hummingbirds. The most common fruit type in this family is a dehiscent capsule containing numerous seeds, but exceptions exist such as an achene, in Phryma leptostachya, or a berry-like fruit in Leucocarpus.\nAbout 16 species are in cultivation. They are known horticulturally as \"Mimulus\" and were formerly placed in the genus Mimulus when it was defined broadly to include about 150 species. Mimulus, as a botanical name, rather than a common name or horticultural name, now represents a genus of only seven species. Most of its former species have been transferred to Diplacus or Erythranthe. Six of the horticultural species are of special importance. These are Diplacus aurantiacus, Diplacus puniceus, Erythranthe cardinalis, Erythranthe guttata, Erythranthe lutea, and Erythranthe cuprea.\nPhrymaceae has recently become a model system for evolutionary studies.\nWithin the order Lamiales, Phrymaceae is a member of an unnamed clade of five families. Two of these families, Mazaceae and Rehmanniaceae are not part of the APG III system. They were not formally validated until 2011.","dates":{"added":1688936036,"dateRange":{"0":1282816094,"1":1687702180}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.749Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Pedaliaceae","deepCounters":{"total":14,"images":13,"folders":1,"files":13},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Pedaliaceae\/%D0%A3%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%93%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%8C%D0%B5%20-%20Uncarina%20grandidieri\/thumbs\/%21tallinn_botanical_garden_palm_house_tropics-36.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Педалиевые - Pedaliaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Pedaliaceae, the pedalium family or sesame family, is a flowering plant family classified in the order Lamiales.

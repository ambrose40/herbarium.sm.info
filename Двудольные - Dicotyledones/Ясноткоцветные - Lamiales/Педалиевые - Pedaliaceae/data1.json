The family includes sesame (Sesamum indicum), the source of sesame seeds.\nIt comprises 13 genera and approximately 70 species. Eight genera are native to the African continent and one genus (Uncarina) is endemic to Madagascar. Four genera (Sesamum, Josephinia, Pedalium and Dicerocaryum) are mainly African natives but they also include regions to the east (including Madagascar, India, Sri Lanka, Malayan Islands and northern Australia).\nThe family has a diverse range of seed and fruit dispersal throughout the various species. Including; animal dispersal via burrs, carried by feet (in Dicerocaryum, Harpagophytum and Josephinia) or caught in the fur of passing animals (Uncarina), winged fruits using the wind for dispersal (Holubia and Pterodiscus), or even winged seeds (Sesamothamnus and Sesamum) or via wind-ballists (Ceratotheca and Rogeria). Wind-ballists are when the fruits open at the top but stay on the plant, then as the stems produce strong movements, the seeds are then gradually expelled.","dates":{"added":1688936036,"dateRange":{"0":1687704832,"1":1687704937}},"fileDate":"2023-07-09T23:16:19.315Z","title":"Педалиевые - Pedaliaceae"}

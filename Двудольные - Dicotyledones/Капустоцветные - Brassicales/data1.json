The largest genera are Draba (440 species), Erysimum (261 species), Lepidium (234 species), Cardamine (233 species), and Alyssum (207 species).\nThe family contains the cruciferous vegetables, including species such as Brassica oleracea (e.g., broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, collards), Brassica rapa (turnip, Chinese cabbage, etc.), Brassica napus (rapeseed, etc.), Raphanus sativus (common radish), Armoracia rusticana (horseradish), Matthiola (stock) and the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress).\nPieris rapae and other butterflies of the family Pieridae are some of the best-known pests of Brassicaceae species planted as commercial crops. Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper) moth is also becoming increasingly problematic for crucifers due to its resistance to commonly used pest control methods.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1274181507,"1":1703334543}},"fileDate":"2023-12-25T15:17:19.625Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Capparaceae","deepCounters":{"total":5,"images":4,"folders":1,"files":4},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Capparaceae\/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D1%8B%20%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%B5%20-%20Capparis%20spinosa\/thumbs\/DSC02503.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Каперсовые - Capparaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as the caper family, are a family of plants in the order Brassicales.

The largest genera are Capparis (about 150 species), Maerua (about 100 species), Boscia (37 species) and Cadaba (30 species).\nThe Capparaceae have long been considered closely related to and have often been included in the Brassicaceae, the mustard family (APG, 1998), in part because both groups produce glucosinolate (mustard oil) compounds. Subsequent molecular studies support Capparaceae sensu stricto as paraphyletic with respect to the Brassicaceae. However Cleome and several related genera are more closely related to members of the Brassicaceae than to the other Capparaceae. These genera are now either placed in the Brassicaceae (as subfamily Clemoideae) or segregated into the Cleomaceae. Several more genera of the traditional Capparaceae are more closely related to other members of the Brassicales, and the relationships of several more remain unresolved. Based on morphological grounds and supported by molecular studies, the American species traditionally identified as Capparis have been transferred to resurrected generic names. Several new genera have also been recently described.","dates":{"added":1458398057,"dateRange":{"0":1342858281,"1":1342858298}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.186Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Caricaceae","deepCounters":{"total":25,"images":24,"folders":1,"files":24},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Caricaceae\/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%B8%D1%8F%20-%20Carica%20papaya\/thumbs\/0DSC00093.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Кариковые - Caricaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Caricaceae are a family of flowering plants in the order Brassicales, found primarily in tropical regions of Central and South America and Africa.

These genera were previously included in the family Capparaceae, but were raised to a distinct family when DNA evidence suggested the genera included in it are more closely related to the Brassicaceae than they are to the Capparaceae. The APG II system allows for Cleomaceae to be included in Brassicaceae.\nIn 1994, a group of scientists including Walter Stephen Judd suggested to merge the Capparaceae (which at that time included the Cleomaceae) with the Brassicaceae. Early DNA-analysis showed that the Capparaceae - as defined at that moment - were paraphyletic, and others suggested to assign the genera closest to the Brassicaceae to the Cleomaceae. The Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae diverged approximately 41 million years ago. All three families have consistently been placed in one order (variably called Capparales or Brassicales). The APG II system, merged Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae. Other classifications have continued to recognise the Capparaceae, but with a more restricted circumscription, either including Cleome and its relatives in the Brassicaceae or recognizing them in the segregate family Cleomaceae. The APG III system has recently adopted this last solution, but this may change as a consensus arises on this point. Current insights in the relationships of the Brassicaceae, based on a 2012 DNA-analysis, are summarized in the following tree.","dates":{"added":1507405992,"dateRange":{"0":1378035047,"1":1500128148}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.202Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Tropaeolaceae","deepCounters":{"total":45,"images":42,"folders":3,"files":42},"counters":{"total":3,"folders":3},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Tropaeolaceae\/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D1%80%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Tropaeolum%20majus\/thumbs\/DSC00542.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Настурциевые - Tropaeolaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Tropaeolum , commonly known as nasturtium (literally \"nose-twister\" or \"nose-tweaker\"), is a genus of roughly 80 species of annual and perennial herbaceous&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Настурциевые - Tropaeolaceae","comment":"Tropaeolum , commonly known as nasturtium (literally \"nose-twister\" or \"nose-tweaker\"), is a genus of roughly 80 species of annual and perennial herbaceous flowering plants.

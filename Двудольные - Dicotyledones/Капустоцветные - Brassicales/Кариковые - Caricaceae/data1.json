They are short-lived evergreen pachycaul shrubs or small trees growing to 5\u201310 m tall. One species, Vasconcellea horovitziana is a liana and the three species of the genus Jarilla are herbs. Some species bear edible fruit and produce papain. \nBased on molecular analyses, this family has been proposed to have originated in Africa in the early Cenozoic era, ~66 million years ago (mya). The dispersal from Africa to Central America occurred ~35 mya, possibly via ocean currents from the Congo delta. From Central America, the family reached South America 19-27 mya.\nThe family comprises six genera and about 34-35 species.","dates":{"added":1649437849,"dateRange":{"0":1355991808,"1":1649417921}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.202Z"}

Members of the family Garryaceae are evergreen, whereas those of the Eucommiaceae are deciduous and produce latex. All members are dioecious.\nThese belong among the asterids. Under the Cronquist system, the Garryaceae were placed among the Cornales. The Eucommiaceae were given their own order and placed among the Hamamelidae. The Oncothecaceae family has been associated with Garryales, though the link is not strong enough to prove they are related.","dates":{"added":1653173232,"dateRange":{"0":1652948554,"1":1652948565}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.919Z","title":"Гарриецветные - Garryales"}

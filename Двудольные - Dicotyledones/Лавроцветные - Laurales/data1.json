The family contains three genera and only 10 known species, restricted to warm temperate and tropical regions:\nThey are aromatic, deciduous shrubs growing to 2\u20134 m tall, except for Idiospermum, which is a large evergreen tree. The flowers are white to red, with spirally arranged tepals. DNA-based phylogenies indicate the Northern Hemisphere Calycanthus and Chimonanthus diverged from each other in the mid-Miocene, while the Australian Idiospermum had already diverged by the Upper Cretaceous and likely represents a remnant of a former Gondwanan distribution of Calycanthaceae that included South America, as indicated by the occurrence of Cretaceous Calycanthaceae fossils in Brazil.\nIn the APG IV system of 2016, Calycanthaceae is placed in the Laurales order in the magnoliids clade.","dates":{"added":1686441193,"dateRange":{"0":1561211343,"1":1686405240}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.280Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Lauraceae","deepCounters":{"total":20,"images":17,"folders":3,"files":17},"counters":{"total":3,"folders":3},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Lauraceae\/%D0%9B%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%8F%20%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Litsea%20glutinosa\/thumbs\/DSC07594.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Лавровые - Lauraceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Lauraceae are the laurel family, that includes the true laurel and its closest relatives.

This family of flowering plants comprises about 2850 known species in about 45 genera worldwide (Christenhusz & Byng 2016 ). They are dicotyledons, and occur mainly in warm temperate and tropical regions, especially Southeast Asia and South America. Many are aromatic evergreen trees or shrubs, but some, such as Sassafras, are deciduous, or include both deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs, especially in tropical and temperate climates. Cassytha is a genus unique to the Lauraceae family in that it is a genus of parasitic vines.","dates":{"added":1640555897,"dateRange":{"0":1304424436,"1":1640167358}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.280Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Лавроцветные - Laurales","comment":"The Laurales are an order of flowering plants. They are magnoliids, related to the Magnoliales.\nThe order includes about 2500-2800 species from 85-90 genera, which comprise seven families of trees and shrubs. Most of the species are tropical and subtropical, though a few genera reach the temperate zone. The best known species in this order are those of the Lauraceae (for example bay laurel, cinnamon, avocado, and Sassafras), and the ornamental shrub Calycanthus of the Calycanthaceae.\nThe earliest lauraceous fossils are from the early Cretaceous. It is possible that the ancient origin of this order is one of the reasons for its highly diverged morphology. Indeed, presently no single morphological property is known, which would unify all the members of Laurales. The presently accepted classification is based on molecular and genetic analysis.","dates":{"added":1686441193,"dateRange":{"0":1304424436,"1":1686405240}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.919Z"}

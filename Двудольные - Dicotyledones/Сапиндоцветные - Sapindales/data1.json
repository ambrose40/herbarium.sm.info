Most species are evergreen, but some are deciduous, either in the dry season or in winter.\nThe family includes about 53 genera and about 600 known species, with a pantropical distribution; one genus (Toona) extends north into temperate China and south into southeast Australia, and another (Melia) nearly as far north.","dates":{"added":1640555898,"dateRange":{"0":1240747428,"1":1640100847}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.499Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%A0%D1%83%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Rutaceae","deepCounters":{"total":404,"images":377,"folders":27,"files":377},"counters":{"total":27,"folders":27},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A0%D1%83%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Rutaceae\/%D0%A0%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B0%20%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F%2C%20%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%85%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Ruta%20graveolens\/thumbs\/DSC03490.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Рутовые - Rutaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Rutaceae are a family, commonly known as the rue or citrus family, of flowering plants, usually placed in the order Sapindales.<br>Species of the family&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Рутовые - Rutaceae","comment":"The Rutaceae are a family, commonly known as the rue or citrus family, of flowering plants, usually placed in the order Sapindales.\nSpecies of the family generally have flowers that divide into four or five parts, usually with strong scents. They range in form and size from herbs to shrubs and large trees.\nThe most economically important genus in the family is Citrus, which includes the orange (C. × sinensis), lemon (C. × limon), grapefruit (C. × paradisi), and lime (various, mostly C. aurantifolia, the key lime). Boronia is a large Australian genus, some members of which are plants with highly fragrant flowers and are used in commercial oil production. Other large genera include Zanthoxylum, Melicope, and Agathosma. About 160 genera are in the family Rutaceae: List of Rutaceae genera.\nMost species are trees or shrubs, a few are herbs (Boenninghausenia and Dictamnus), frequently aromatic with glands on the leaves, sometimes with thorns. The leaves are usually opposed and compound, and without stipules. Pellucid glands, a type of oil gland, are found in the leaves responsible for the aromatic smell of the family's members; traditionally they have been the primary synapomorphic characteristic to identify the Rutaceae.\nFlowers are bractless, solitary or in cyme, rarely in raceme, and mainly pollinated by insects. They are radially or (rarely) laterally symmetric, and generally hermaphroditic. They have four or five petals and sepals, sometimes three, mostly separate, eight to ten stamen (five in Skimmia, many in Citrus), usually separate or in several groups. Usually a single stigma with 2 to 5 united carpels, sometimes ovaries separate but styles combined.\n\nThe fruit of the Rutaceae are very variable: berries, drupes, hesperidia, samaras, capsules, and follicles all occur. Seed number also varies widely.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1240841526,"1":1703252190}},"fileDate":"2023-12-25T14:39:30.307Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Sapindaceae","deepCounters":{"total":631,"images":602,"folders":29,"files":602},"counters":{"total":29,"folders":29},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Sapindaceae\/%D0%9A%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%20%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Acer%20platanoides\/thumbs\/DSC01465.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Сапиндовые - Sapindaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Sapindaceae are a family of flowering plants in the order Sapindales known as the soapberry family.

It contains 138 genera and 1858 accepted species, including maple, ackee, horse chestnut and lychee.\nThe Sapindaceae occur in temperate to tropical regions, many in laurel forest habitat, throughout the world. Many are laticiferous, i.e. they contain latex, a milky sap, and many contain mildly toxic saponins with soap-like qualities in either the foliage and\/or the seeds, or roots. The largest genera are Serjania, Paullinia, Acer and Allophylus.\nThe largely temperate genera formerly separated in the families Aceraceae (Acer, Dipteronia) and Hippocastanaceae (Aesculus, Billia, Handeliodendron) were included within a more broadly circumscribed Sapindaceae by the APG. Recent research has confirmed the inclusion of these genera in Sapindaceae.","dates":{"added":1696640557,"dateRange":{"0":1240249490,"1":1694264282}},"fileDate":"2023-05-14T21:00:37.589Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Nitrariaceae","deepCounters":{"total":6,"images":5,"folders":1,"files":5},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Nitrariaceae\/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%2C%20%20%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0%20%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Nitraria%20retusa\/thumbs\/DSC00181.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Селитрянковые - Nitrariaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Nitrariaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Sapindales.

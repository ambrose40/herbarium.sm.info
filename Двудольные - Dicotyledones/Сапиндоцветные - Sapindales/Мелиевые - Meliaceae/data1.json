Most species are evergreen, but some are deciduous, either in the dry season or in winter.\nThe family includes about 53 genera and about 600 known species, with a pantropical distribution; one genus (Toona) extends north into temperate China and south into southeast Australia, and another (Melia) nearly as far north.","dates":{"added":1640555898,"dateRange":{"0":1240747428,"1":1640100847}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.499Z"}

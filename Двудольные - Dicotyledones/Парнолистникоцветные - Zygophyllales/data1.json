The family includes around 285 species in 22 genera.\nIn the APG III system of classification, the families Zygophyllaceae and Krameriaceae compose the order Zygophyllales. In the previous version of their classification system, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group had included the option of placing Krameria within Zygophyllaceae.\nZygophyllaceae are divided into five subfamilies. Molecular phylogenies of the family were published in 2000, and 2018. Phylogenies of groups within the family, particularly the predominantly southern African species of Zygophylloideae have also been published.\nPlants in the family Zygophyllaceae may be trees, shrubs, or herbs. They are often found in dry habitats. The leaves are usually opposite, often with stipules and spines. Some are cultivated as ornamental plants, such as Guaiacum, Zygophyllum, Tribulus, and Larrea species. King Clone, a creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) in California, may be the oldest living organism.","dates":{"added":1455132371,"dateRange":{"0":1326724796,"1":1326975043}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.452Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Парнолистникоцветные - Zygophyllales","comment":"The Zygophyllales are an order of dicotyledonous plants, comprising the following two families: Zygophyllaceae, Krameriaceae.\nAccording to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG II) both families are unplaced to order, but nevertheless included in the Eurosids I. The APG III system of 2009, however, recognized this order. Even if the monogeneric family Krameriaceae shares little common traits with the family Zygophyllaceae, researchers see little advantage in keeping it as a separate family (e.g. Sheahan and Chase). The name Zygophyllales can be used if one finds it appropriate to place both families into an order. The order keeps unchanged in the APG IV system.\nUnder the Cronquist system, the Zygophyllaceae were included within the Sapindales, and the Krameriaceae within the Polygalales.","dates":{"added":1455132371,"dateRange":{"0":1326724796,"1":1326975043}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.935Z"}

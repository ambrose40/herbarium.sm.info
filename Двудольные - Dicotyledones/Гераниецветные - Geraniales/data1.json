The family name is derived from the genus Geranium. The family includes both the genus Geranium (the cranesbills, or true geraniums) and the garden plants called geraniums, which modern botany classifies as genus Pelargonium, along with other related genera.\nThe family comprises 830 species in five to seven genera. Numerically, the most important genera are Geranium (430 species), Pelargonium (280 species) and Erodium (80 species).","dates":{"added":1688880096,"dateRange":{"0":1240833408,"1":1688790795}},"fileDate":"2023-06-11T02:32:49.12Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Гераниецветные - Geraniales","comment":"Geraniales are a small order of flowering plants, included within the rosid subclade of eudicots. The largest family in the order is Geraniaceae with over 800 species. In addition, the order includes the smaller Francoaceae with about 40 species. Most Geraniales are herbaceous, but there are also shrubs and small trees.\nThe economic importance of Geraniales is low. Some species of the genus Pelargonium (Geraniaceae) are cultivated for their aromatic oil used in the perfume industry. Some other species, also mostly within Geraniaceae, have horticultural or medicinal uses. A Paleobotanic record is missing.","dates":{"added":1688880096,"dateRange":{"0":1240833408,"1":1688790795}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.919Z"}

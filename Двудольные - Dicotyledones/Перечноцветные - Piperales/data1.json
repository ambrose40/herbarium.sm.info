The type genus is Aristolochia L.\nThey are mostly perennial, herbaceous plants, shrubs, or lianas. The membranous, cordate simple leaves are spread out, growing alternately along the stem on leaf stalks. The margins are commonly entire. No stipules are present. The bizarre flowers are large to medium-sized, growing in the leaf axils. They are bilaterally or radially symmetrical.\nAristolochiaceae are magnoliids, a basal group of angiosperms which are not part of the large categories of monocots or eudicots. As of APG IV APG IV (2016), the former families Hydnoraceae and Lactoridaceae are included, because exclusion would make Aristolochiaceae in the traditional sense paraphyletic.\nSome newer classification schemes, such as the update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, place the family Aristolochiaceae in the order Piperales, but it is still quite common, though superseded, for the Aristolochiaceae to be assigned, sometimes with some other families, their own order (Aristolochiales).","dates":{"added":1688936036,"dateRange":{"0":1381575736,"1":1687704386}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.483Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Piperaceae","deepCounters":{"total":23,"images":20,"folders":3,"files":20},"counters":{"total":3,"folders":3},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Piperaceae\/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%86%20%D0%B4%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Piper%20longum\/thumbs\/DSC05503.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Перечные - Piperaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Piperaceae, also known as the pepper family, are a large family of flowering plants.

The group contains roughly 3,600 currently accepted species in 13 genera. The vast majority of peppers can be found within the two main genera: Piper (2000 species) and Peperomia (1600 species).\nMembers of the Piperaceae may be small trees, shrubs, or herbs. The distribution of this group is best described as pantropical.\nThe best-known species is Piper nigrum, which yields most peppercorns that are used as spices, including black pepper, although its relatives in the family include many other spices.","dates":{"added":1548534480,"dateRange":{"0":1356337912,"1":1548500463}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.452Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Перечноцветные - Piperales","comment":"Piperales is a botanical name for an order of flowering plants.

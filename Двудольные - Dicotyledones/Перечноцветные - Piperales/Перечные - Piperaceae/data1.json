The group contains roughly 3,600 currently accepted species in 13 genera. The vast majority of peppers can be found within the two main genera: Piper (2000 species) and Peperomia (1600 species).\nMembers of the Piperaceae may be small trees, shrubs, or herbs. The distribution of this group is best described as pantropical.\nThe best-known species is Piper nigrum, which yields most peppercorns that are used as spices, including black pepper, although its relatives in the family include many other spices.","dates":{"added":1548534480,"dateRange":{"0":1356337912,"1":1548500463}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.452Z"}

The family is not recognized by all taxonomic systems, the single species, Simmondsia chinensis, often being treated as belonging to family Buxaceae.\nThe APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), does recognize this family and assigns it to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots. It consist of a single species only, jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis), of North American shrubs.\nThe Cronquist system, 1981, had also recognized this family and placed it in order Euphorbiales.","dates":{"added":1396911736,"dateRange":{"0":1391078119,"1":1391078133}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.233Z"}

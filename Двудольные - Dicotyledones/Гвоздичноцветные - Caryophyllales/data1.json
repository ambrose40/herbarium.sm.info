The family is present worldwide, but is most diverse in the North Temperate Zone.\nSeveral species are cultivated as ornamentals. A few species of Triplaris provide lumber. The fruit of the sea grape (Coccoloba uvifera) is eaten, and in Florida, jelly is made from it and sold commercially. The seeds of two species of Fagopyrum, known as buckwheat (sarrasin in French), provide grain (its dark flour is known as blé noir (black wheat) in France). The petioles of rhubarb (Rheum rhabarbarum and hybrids) are a food item.

The word&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Кактусовые - Cactaceae","comment":"A cactus is a member of the plant family Cactaceae, a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order Caryophyllales. The word \"cactus\" derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek κάκτος, kaktos, a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is not certain. Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth. Cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. Almost all cacti are succulents, meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending against herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade. In the absence of leaves, enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis. Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north\u2014except for Rhipsalis baccifera, which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka.\nCactus spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles, a kind of highly reduced branch. Areoles are an identifying feature of cacti. As well as spines, areoles give rise to flowers, which are usually tubular and multipetaled. Many cacti have short growing seasons and long dormancies, and are able to react quickly to any rainfall, helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root system that quickly absorbs any water reaching the ground surface. Cactus stems are often ribbed or fluted, which allows them to expand and contract easily for quick water absorption after rain, followed by long drought periods. Like other succulent plants, most cacti employ a special mechanism called \"crassulacean acid metabolism\" (CAM) as part of photosynthesis. Transpiration, during which carbon dioxide enters the plant and water escapes, does not take place during the day at the same time as photosynthesis, but instead occurs at night. The plant stores the carbon dioxide it takes in as malic acid, retaining it until daylight returns, and only then using it in photosynthesis. Because transpiration takes place during the cooler, more humid night hours, water loss is significantly reduced.\nMany smaller cacti have globe-shaped stems, combining the highest possible volume for water storage, with the lowest possible surface area for water loss from transpiration. The tallest free-standing cactus is Pachycereus pringlei, with a maximum recorded height of 19.2 m (63 ft), and the smallest is Blossfeldia liliputiana, only about 1 cm (0.4 in) in diameter at maturity. A fully grown saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) is said to be able to absorb as much as 200 U.S. gallons (760 l; 170 imp gal) of water during a rainstorm. A few species differ significantly in appearance from most of the family. At least superficially, plants of the genus Pereskia resemble other trees and shrubs growing around them. They have persistent leaves, and when older, bark-covered stems. Their areoles identify them as cacti, and in spite of their appearance, they, too, have many adaptations for water conservation. Pereskia is considered close to the ancestral species from which all cacti evolved. In tropical regions, other cacti grow as forest climbers and epiphytes (plants that grow on trees). Their stems are typically flattened, almost leaf-like in appearance, with fewer or even no spines, such as the well-known Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus (in the genus Schlumbergera).\n\nCacti have a variety of uses: many species are used as ornamental plants, others are grown for fodder or forage, and others for food (particularly their fruit). Cochineal is the product of an insect that lives on some cacti.\n\nMany succulent plants in both the Old and New World, such as some Euphorbiaceae (euphorbias), bear a striking resemblance to cacti, and may incorrectly be called \"cactus\" in common usage.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1214066542,"1":1703075605}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.342Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Phytolaccaceae","deepCounters":{"total":22,"images":20,"folders":2,"files":20},"counters":{"total":2,"folders":2},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Phytolaccaceae\/%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%20%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B8%20-%20Phytolacca%20americana\/thumbs\/DSC02492.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Лаконосовые - Phytolaccaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Phytolaccaceae is a family of flowering plants.

The genus comprises roughly 150 species, and numerous natural and many cultivated hybrids. They are mostly liana-forming plants of the Old World tropics, ranging from South China, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines; westward to Madagascar (two species) and the Seychelles (one); southward to Australia (three) and New Caledonia (one); and northward to India (one) and Sri Lanka (one). The greatest diversity occurs on Borneo, Sumatra, and the Philippines, with many endemic species. Many are plants of hot, humid, lowland areas, but the majority are tropical montane plants, receiving warm days but cool to cold, humid nights year round. A few are considered tropical alpine, with cool days and nights near freezing. The name \"monkey cups\" refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.","dates":{"added":1473789019,"dateRange":{"0":1473601964,"1":1473602007}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.233Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9D%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Nyctaginaceae","deepCounters":{"total":38,"images":34,"folders":4,"files":34},"counters":{"total":4,"folders":4},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9D%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Nyctaginaceae\/%D0%91%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%8F%20%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Bougainvillea%20glabra\/thumbs\/DSC02273.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Ночецветные - Nyctaginaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Nyctaginaceae, the four o'clock family, is a family of around 33 genera and 290 species of flowering plants, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Ночецветные - Nyctaginaceae","comment":"Nyctaginaceae, the four o'clock family, is a family of around 33 genera and 290 species of flowering plants, widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, with a few representatives in temperate regions.

The APG II system (2003; unchanged from the APG system of 1998), assigns it to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots.\nA phylogenetic study by Levin has justified the combination of Selinocarpus and Ammocodon into the genus Acleisanthes. The genus Izabalea is now considered a synonym of Agonandra, a genus in Opiliaceae. A more recent study by Douglas and Manos clarified the relationships among almost all of the genera in the family and demonstrated that a substantial diversification of herbaceous genera has occurred in arid North America. Many genera of Nyctaginaceae possess unusual characters. Notable examples include sticky bands on the stems between the nodes, cleistogamous flowers (which self-pollinate without opening), or gypsophily, the ability to grow on soils with a high concentration of gypsum.","dates":{"added":1627227935,"dateRange":{"0":1240754846,"1":1627213227}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.280Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Portulacaceae","deepCounters":{"total":20,"images":17,"folders":3,"files":17},"counters":{"total":3,"folders":3},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Portulacaceae\/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BA%20%D0%B7%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Portulaca%20umbraticola\/thumbs\/DSC02815.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Портулаковые - Portulacaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Portulacaceae are a family of flowering plants, comprising 115 species in a single genus Portulaca.

Both Dionaea and Aldrovanda have only one extant species. Droseras secrete a sticky substance from their leaves that traps prey. Dionaea and Aldrovanda both use snap-traps that close rapidly when the leaves are disturbed, Dionaea is terrestrial, while Aldrovanda is strictly aquatic. Like carnivorous plants of other families, the Droseraceae are able to supplement their nutrient intake, especially that of nitrogen, by capturing and digesting small animals such as insects.

Many members are succulent, having fleshy stems or leaves.\nThe members of Caryophyllales include about 6% of eudicot species. This order is part of the core eudicots. Currently, the Caryophyllales contains 33 families, 692 genera and 11,155 species. The monophyly of the Caryophyllales has been supported by DNA sequences, cytochrome c sequence data and heritable characters such as anther wall development and vessel-elements with simple perforations.\nAs with all taxa, the circumscription of Caryophyllales has changed within various classification systems. All systems recognize a core of families with centrospermous ovules and seeds. More recent treatments have expanded the Caryophyllales to include many carnivorous plants.\nAlthough the monophyly of the order has been strongly supported, their placement is still uncertain. Systematists are undecided on whether Caryophyllales should be placed within the rosid complex or sister to the asterid clade. The possible connection between sympetalous angiosperms and Caryophyllales was presaged by Bessey, Hutchinson, and others; as Lawrence relates: \"The evidence is reasonably conclusive that the Primulaceae and the Caryophyllaceae have fundamentally the same type of gynecia, and as concluded by Douglas (1936)(and essentially Dickson, 1936) '...the vascular pattern and the presence of locules at the base of the ovary point to the fact that the present much reduced flower of the Primulaceae has descended from an ancestor which was characterized by a plurilocular ovary and axial placentation. This primitive flower might well be found in centrospermal stock as Wernham, Bessy, and Hutchinson have suggested.' \"\nCaryophyllales is separated into two suborders: Caryophyllineae and Polygonineae. These two suborders were formerly (and sometimes still are) recognized as two orders, Polygonales and Caryophyllales.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1214066542,"1":1703075605}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.919Z"}

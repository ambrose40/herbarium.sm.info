It consists of two subfamilies: Magnolioideae, of which Magnolia is the most well-known genus, and Liriodendroidae, a monogeneric subfamily, of which Liriodendron (tulip trees) is the only genus.\nUnlike most angiosperms, whose flower parts are in whorls (rings), the Magnoliaceae have their stamens and pistils in spirals on a conical receptacle. This arrangement is found in some fossil plants and is believed to be a basal or early condition for angiosperms. The flowers also have parts not distinctly differentiated into sepals and petals, while angiosperms that evolved later tend to have distinctly differentiated sepals and petals. The poorly differentiated perianth parts that occupy both positions are known as tepals.\nThe family has about 219 species in seven genera, although some classification systems include all of subfamily Magnolioideae in genus Magnolia. The family ranges across subtropical eastern North America, Mexico and Central America, the West Indies, tropical South America, southern and eastern India, Sri Lanka, Indochina, Malesia, China, Japan, and Korea.","dates":{"added":1686441193,"dateRange":{"0":1342774791,"1":1686405092}},"fileDate":"2023-06-11T02:16:12.380Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Annonaceae","deepCounters":{"total":28,"images":24,"folders":4,"files":24},"counters":{"total":4,"folders":4},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Annonaceae\/%D0%90%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%20%D0%B4%D1%83%D1%88%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Artabotrys%20hexapetalus\/thumbs\/0DSC06556_.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Анноновые - Annonaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Annonaceae are a family, the custard apple family, of flowering plants consisting of trees, shrubs, or rarely lianas.

With 108 accepted genera and about 2400 known species, it is the largest family in the Magnoliales. Several genera produce edible fruit, most notably Annona, Anonidium, Asimina, Rollinia, and Uvaria. Its type genus is Annona. The family is concentrated in the tropics, with few species found in temperate regions. About 900 species are Neotropical, 450 are Afrotropical, and the other species Indomalayan.","dates":{"added":1684089825,"dateRange":{"0":1356338957,"1":1682847208}},"fileDate":"2023-05-14T21:02:40.423Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Магнолиецветные - Magnoliales","comment":"The Magnoliales comprise an order of flowering plants.","dates":{"added":1686441193,"dateRange":{"0":1342774791,"1":1686405092}},"fileDate":"2023-04-23T17:05:42.318Z"}

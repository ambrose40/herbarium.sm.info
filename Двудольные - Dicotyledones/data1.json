Until recently, the composition of the order and its division into families varied greatly from one author to another.\nThe Celastrales are a diverse order that has no conspicuous distinguishing characteristic, so is consequently hard to recognize. The flowers are usually small with a conspicuous nectary disk. The stipules are small or rarely absent. The micropyle has two openings and is therefore called a bistomal micropyle. Flowers with well-developed male and female parts are often functionally unisexual. The seed often has an aril. In bud, the sepals have a quincuncial arrangement. This means that two sepals are inside, two are outside, and the remaining sepal is half inside and half outside.","dates":{"added":1686441193,"dateRange":{"0":1316781030,"1":1686404336}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.919Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Fabales","keywords":["Бобовоцветные","Fabales"],"deepCounters":{"total":1854,"images":1725,"folders":127,"files":1727,"others":2},"counters":{"total":2,"folders":2},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Fabales\/%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Fabaceae\/%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%85%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B8%20-%20Pisum%20sativum\/thumbs\/DSC01798.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Бобовоцветные - Fabales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Fabales are an order of flowering plants included in the rosid group of the eudicots in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II classification system.

Under the Cronquist system and some other plant classification systems, the order Fabales contains only the family Fabaceae. In the classification system of Dahlgren the Fabales were in the superorder Fabiflorae (also called Fabanae) with three familiese corresponding to the subfamilies of Fabaceae in APG II. The other families treated in the Fabales by the APG II classification were placed in separate orders by Cronquist, the Polygalaceae within its own order, the Polygalales, and the Quillajaceae and Surianaceae within the Rosales.\nThe Fabaceae, as the third-largest plant family in the world, contain most of the diversity of the Fabales, the other families making up a comparatively small portion of the order's diversity. Research in the order is largely focused on the Fabaceae, due in part to its great biological diversity, and to its importance as food plants. The Polygalaceae are fairly well researched among plant families, in part due to the large diversity of the genus Polygala, and other members of the family being food plants for various Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species. While taxonomists using molecular phylogenetic techniques find strong support for the order, questions remain about the morphological relationships of the Quillajaceae and Surianaceae to the rest of the order, due in part to limited research on these families.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1223233548,"1":1703250223}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.919Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%91%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Fagales","deepCounters":{"total":644,"images":596,"folders":48,"files":596},"counters":{"total":6,"folders":6},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%91%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Fagales\/%D0%91%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Fagaceae\/%D0%91%D1%83%D0%BA%20%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B8%20-%20Fagus%20sylvatica\/thumbs\/0DSC08809.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Букоцветные - Fagales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Fagales are an order of flowering plants, including some of the best-known trees.

The circumscription of Boraginales is essentially identical to the circumscription of Boraginaceae sensu APG. The APG III system takes a broad view of Boraginaceae, including within it the traditionally recognized families Hydrophyllaceae and Lennoaceae based on recent molecular phylogenies that show that Boraginaceae, as traditionally defined, is paraphyletic over these two families. APG III includes Boraginaceae in the Euasterid I (lamiid) clade but this family is otherwise unplaced; its precise relationship to other families in the Euasterid I group remains unclear. In a phylogenetic study of DNA sequences of selected genes, Boraginales was resolved as sister to Lamiales sensu APG, but that result had only 65% maximum likelihood bootstrap support.\nIn the 2016 APG IV system Boraginales is an order with only one family Boraginaceae, which includes the former family Codonaceae.\nIn the Cronquist system, Boraginaceae (including Cordiaceae, Ehretiaceae, and Heliotropiaceae) and Lennoaceae were placed in Lamiales, and Hydrophyllaceae in Solanales.","dates":{"added":1687206998,"dateRange":{"0":1211050476,"1":1687093707}},"fileDate":"2023-04-23T16:59:23.306Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Ericales","deepCounters":{"total":1959,"images":1836,"folders":123,"files":1836},"counters":{"total":10,"folders":10},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Ericales\/%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Ericaceae\/%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Calluna%20vulgaris\/thumbs\/DSC03593.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Верескоцветные - Ericales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Ericales are a large and diverse order of dicotyledons, including, for example, tea, persimmon, blueberry, Brazil nut, and azalea.

Fusion of the petals as a trait was traditionally used to place the order in the subclass Sympetalae.\nMycorrhiza is an interesting property, frequently associated with the Ericales. Indeed, symbiosis with root fungi is quite common among the order representatives, and three kinds of it can be found exclusively among Ericales (namely, ericoid, arbutoid and monotropoid mycorrhiza). In addition, some families among the order are notable for their exceptional ability to accumulate aluminum.\nEricales are a cosmopolitan order.

Molecular phylogenetic studies place the Vitales as the most basal clade in the rosids.\nIn the Cronquist system, the family was placed near the family Rhamnaceae in order Rhamnales.\nMost Vitis species have 38 chromosomes (n=19), but 40 (n=20) in subgenus Muscadinia, while Ampelocissus, Parthenocissus, and Ampelopsis also have 40 chromosomes (n=20) and Cissus has 24 chromosomes (n=12).\nThe family is economically important as the berries of Vitis species, commonly known as grapes, are an important fruit crop and, when fermented, produce wine.\nSpecies of the genus Tetrastigma serve as hosts to parasitic plants in the family Rafflesiaceae.\nLeea, sometimes classified in its own family, Leeaceae, is included in Vitaceae by APG IV (2016) and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website.","dates":{"added":1686441193,"dateRange":{"0":1213467868,"1":1686404243}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.919Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%92%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%81%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Dipsacales","deepCounters":{"total":974,"images":915,"folders":59,"files":915},"counters":{"total":2,"folders":2},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%92%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%81%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Dipsacales\/%D0%90%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Adoxaceae\/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Viburnum%20opulus\/thumbs\/DSC00428_.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Ворсянкоцветные - Dipsacales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Dipsacales are an order of flowering plants, included within the asterid group of dicotyledons.

Many members are succulent, having fleshy stems or leaves.\nThe members of Caryophyllales include about 6% of eudicot species. This order is part of the core eudicots. Currently, the Caryophyllales contains 33 families, 692 genera and 11,155 species. The monophyly of the Caryophyllales has been supported by DNA sequences, cytochrome c sequence data and heritable characters such as anther wall development and vessel-elements with simple perforations.\nAs with all taxa, the circumscription of Caryophyllales has changed within various classification systems. All systems recognize a core of families with centrospermous ovules and seeds. More recent treatments have expanded the Caryophyllales to include many carnivorous plants.\nAlthough the monophyly of the order has been strongly supported, their placement is still uncertain. Systematists are undecided on whether Caryophyllales should be placed within the rosid complex or sister to the asterid clade. The possible connection between sympetalous angiosperms and Caryophyllales was presaged by Bessey, Hutchinson, and others; as Lawrence relates: \"The evidence is reasonably conclusive that the Primulaceae and the Caryophyllaceae have fundamentally the same type of gynecia, and as concluded by Douglas (1936)(and essentially Dickson, 1936) '...the vascular pattern and the presence of locules at the base of the ovary point to the fact that the present much reduced flower of the Primulaceae has descended from an ancestor which was characterized by a plurilocular ovary and axial placentation. This primitive flower might well be found in centrospermal stock as Wernham, Bessy, and Hutchinson have suggested.' \"\nCaryophyllales is separated into two suborders: Caryophyllineae and Polygonineae. These two suborders were formerly (and sometimes still are) recognized as two orders, Polygonales and Caryophyllales.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1214066542,"1":1703075605}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.919Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Geraniales","deepCounters":{"total":468,"images":434,"folders":34,"files":434},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Geraniales\/%D0%96%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Geraniaceae\/%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8C%20%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%8B%20-%20Geranium%20maderense\/thumbs\/DSC06703.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Гераниецветные - Geraniales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Geraniales are a small order of flowering plants, included within the rosid subclade of eudicots.

The families Sonneratiaceae, Trapaceae, and Punicaceae are removed from the Lythraceae. In the classification system of Dahlgren the Myrtales were in the superorder Myrtiflorae (also called Myrtanae). The APG III system agrees with the older Cronquist circumscriptions of treating Psiloxylaceae and Heteropyxidaceae within Myrtaceae, and Memecyclaceae within Melastomataceae.\nEllagitannins are reported in dicotyledoneous angiospermes, and notably in species in the order Myrtales.\nMyrtales is dated to have begun 89\u201399 million years ago (mya) in Australasia. There is some contention as to that date however, which was obtained using nuclear DNA. When looking at chloroplast DNA, the myrtales ancestor is instead considered to have evolved in the mid-Cretaceous period (100 mya) in Southeast Africa, rather than in Australasia. Although the APG system classifies myrtales as within the eurosids, the recently published genome of Eucalyptus grandis places the order myrtales as a sister to the eurosids rather than inside them. The discrepancy is thought to have arisen due to the difference between using a large number of taxa versus using a large number of genes for constructing a phylogeny.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1135731404,"1":1703250072}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.935Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Aquifoliales","deepCounters":{"total":48,"images":40,"folders":6,"files":42,"others":2},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Aquifoliales\/%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Aquifoliaceae\/%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%B1%20%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Ilex%20aquifolium\/thumbs\/DSC02147.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Падубоцветные - Aquifoliales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Aquifoliales are an order of flowering plants, including the Aquifoliaceae (or holly) family, and also the Helwingiaceae (2-5 species of temperate Asian&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Падубоцветные - Aquifoliales","comment":"The Aquifoliales are an order of flowering plants, including the Aquifoliaceae (or holly) family, and also the Helwingiaceae (2-5 species of temperate Asian shrubs) and the Phyllonomaceae (4 species of Central American trees and shrubs).

The order includes the family Buxaceae; the families Didymelaceae and Haptanthaceae may also be recognized or may be included in the Buxaceae. Many members of the order are evergreen shrubs or trees, although some are herbaceous perennials. They have separate \"male\" (staminate) and \"female\" (carpellate) flowers, mostly on the same plant (i.e. they are mostly monoecious). Some species are of economic importance either for the wood they produce or as ornamental plants.\nThe Buxales have relatively few obvious shared features distinguishing them from related groups of plants (i.e. few obvious synapomorphies). One is the presence of a particular type of alkaloid or pseudoalkaloid, pregnane steroids. They have unisexual flowers (i.e. separate staminate or \"male\" flowers and carpellate or \"female\" flowers), most being monoecious. The flowers are small, less than 7 mm across. The tepals have a single vascular bundle (trace). Other characters common to the order include leaves with entire (untoothed) margins, flowers arranged in racemes, small styles capable of receiving pollen along their entire length rather than having a separate stigma, one to two ovules per carpel, and seeds with testae (coats) made up of several cell layers.\nDidymeles, the sole genus in the family Didymelaceae, consists of two species of evergreen tree occurring only in Madagascar. It is dioecious, i.e. with staminate and carpellate flowers on separate plants. Buxaceae (including Haptanthaceae) is more diverse, with five or six genera totalling about 115 species, and is found in most temperate and tropical areas of the world. Most species are evergreen shrubs or small trees, but some (such as those of Pachysandra) are herbaceous perennials.","dates":{"added":1651341518,"dateRange":{"0":1368021490,"1":1651332437}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.935Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Santalales","deepCounters":{"total":23,"images":21,"folders":2,"files":21},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Santalales\/%D0%9E%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Viscaceae\/%D0%9E%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B0%20%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Viscum%20album\/thumbs\/DSC07472.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Санталоцветные - Santalales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Santalales are an order of flowering plants with a cosmopolitan distribution, but heavily concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions.

The families are those recognized in the APG III system. This is typical of the newer classifications, though there is some slight variation and in particular, the Torriceliaceae may be divided.\n\nUnder this definition, well-known members include carrots, celery, parsley, and Hedera helix (English ivy).\n\nThe order Apiales is placed within the asterid group of eudicots as circumscribed by the APG III system. Within the asterids, Apiales belongs to an unranked group called the campanulids, and within the campanulids, it belongs to a clade known in phylogenetic nomenclature as Apiidae. In 2010, a subclade of Apiidae named Dipsapiidae was defined to consist of the three orders: Apiales, Paracryphiales, and Dipsacales.\n\nUnder the Cronquist system, only the Apiaceae and Araliaceae were included here, and the restricted order was placed among the rosids rather than the asterids. The Pittosporaceae were placed within the Rosales, and many of the other forms within the family Cornaceae. Pennantia was in the family Icacinaceae. In the classification system of Dahlgren the Apiaceae and Araliaceae families were placed in the order Ariales, in the superorder Araliiflorae (also called Aralianae).\n\nThe present understanding of the Apiales is fairly recent and is based upon comparison of DNA sequences by phylogenetic methods. The circumscriptions of some of the families have changed. In 2009, one of the subfamilies of Araliaceae was shown to be polyphyletic.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1240762352,"1":1703253178}},"fileDate":"2023-04-23T17:14:40.0Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%A2%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Cucurbitales","deepCounters":{"total":531,"images":481,"folders":50,"files":481},"counters":{"total":3,"folders":3},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A2%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Cucurbitales\/%D0%A2%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Cucurbitaceae\/%D0%A6%D1%83%D0%BA%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%20-%20Cucurbita%20pepo%20var.%20cylindrica\/thumbs\/DSC08910.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Тыквоцветные - Cucurbitales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Cucurbitales are an order of flowering plants, included in the rosid group of dicotyledons.

This order mostly belongs to tropical areas, with limited presence in subtropic and temperate regions. The order includes shrubs and trees, together with many herbs and climbers. One major characteristic of the Cucurbitales is the presence of unisexual flowers, mostly pentacyclic, with thick pointed petals (whenever present). The pollination is usually performed by insects, but wind pollination is also present (in Coriariaceae and Datiscaceae).\nThe order consists of roughly 2600 species in eight families. The largest families are Begoniaceae (begonia family) with around 1500 species and Cucurbitaceae (gourd family) with around 900 species. These two families include the only economically important plants. Specifically, the Cucurbitaceae (gourd family) include some food species, such as squash, pumpkin (both from Cucurbita), watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris), and cucumber and melons (Cucumis). The Begoniaceae are known for their horticultural species, of which there are over 130 with many more varieties.","dates":{"added":1696640557,"dateRange":{"0":1135827843,"1":1694446342}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.935Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%AD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Escalloniales","deepCounters":{"total":21,"images":19,"folders":2,"files":19},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%AD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Escalloniales\/%D0%AD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Escalloniaceae\/%D0%AD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Escallonia%20virgata\/thumbs\/00DSC09048.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Эскаллониецветные - Escalloniales<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Escalloniaceae is a family of flowering plants consisting of about 130 species in seven genera.

It includes about 23,810 species, 1,059 genera, and is divided into about 24 families. Well-known or economically important members of this order include lavender, lilac, olive, jasmine, the ash tree, teak, snapdragon, sesame, psyllium, garden sage, and a number of table herbs such as mint, basil, and rosemary.\nThe Lamiales previously had a restricted circumscription (e.g., by Arthur Cronquist) that included the major families Lamiaceae (Labiatae), Verbenaceae, and Boraginaceae, plus a few smaller families. In the classification system of Dahlgren the Lamiales were in the superorder Lamiiflorae (also called Lamianae). Recent phylogenetic work has shown the Lamiales are polyphyletic with respect to order Scrophulariales and the two groups are now usually combined in a single order that also includes the former orders Hippuridales and Plantaginales. Lamiales has become the preferred name for this much larger combined group. The placement of the Boraginaceae is unclear, but phylogenetic work shows this family does not belong in Lamiales.\nAlso, the circumscription of family Scrophulariaceae, formerly a paraphyletic group defined primarily by plesiomorphic characters and from within which numerous other families of the Lamiales were derived, has been radically altered to create a number of smaller, better-defined, and putatively monophyletic families.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1211652033,"1":1703328057}},"fileDate":"2023-07-09T23:09:07.204Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Двудольные - Dicotyledones","comment":"The dicotyledons, also known as dicots (or more rarely dicotyls), were one of the two groups into which all the flowering plants or angiosperms were formerly divided. The name refers to one of the typical characteristics of the group, namely that the seed has two embryonic leaves or cotyledons. There are around 200,000 species within this group. The other group of flowering plants were called monocotyledons or monocots, typically having one cotyledon. Historically, these two groups formed the two divisions of the flowering plants. so they can not divide in two equal parts. Largely from the 1990s onwards, molecular phylogenetic research confirmed what had already been suspected, namely that dicotyledons are not a group made up of all the descendants of a common ancestor (i.e. they are not a monophyletic group). Rather, a number of lineages, such as the magnoliids and groups now collectively known as the basal angiosperms, diverged earlier than the monocots did. The traditional dicots are thus a paraphyletic group. The largest clade of the dicotyledons are known as the eudicots. They are distinguished from all other flowering plants by the structure of their pollen. Other dicotyledons and monocotyledons have monosulcate pollen, or forms derived from it, whereas eudicots have tricolpate pollen, or derived forms, the pollen having three or more pores set in furrows called colpi.","dates":{"added":1709663818,"dateRange":{"0":1115479862,"1":1709300745}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:09.752Z"}

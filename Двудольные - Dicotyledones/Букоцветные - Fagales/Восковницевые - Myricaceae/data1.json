There are three genera in the family, although some botanists separate many species from Myrica into a fourth genus Morella. About 55 species are usually accepted in Myrica, one in Canacomyrica, and one in Comptonia.\nWell-known members of this family include bayberry and sweetfern.","dates":{"added":1552410963,"dateRange":{"0":1468058368,"1":1543404423}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:46.999Z"}

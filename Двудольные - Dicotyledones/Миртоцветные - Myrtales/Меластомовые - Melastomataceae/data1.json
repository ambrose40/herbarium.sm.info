Melastomes are annual or perennial herbs, shrubs, or small trees.\n\nThe leaves of melastomes are somewhat distinctive, being opposite, decussate, and usually with 3-7 longitudinal veins arising either from the base of the blade, plinerved (inner veins diverging above base of blade), or pinnately nerved with three or more pairs of primary veins diverging from the mid-vein at successive points above the base.\n\nFlowers are perfect, and borne either singly or in terminal or axillary, paniculate cymes.\n\nA number of melastomes are regarded as invasive species once naturalized in tropical and subtropical environments outside their normal range. Examples are Koster's curse (Clidemia hirta), Tibouchina semidecandra and Miconia calvescens, but many other species are involved.\n\nUnder the APG III system of classification, the seven genera from Memecylaceae are now included in this family.","dates":{"added":1640555897,"dateRange":{"0":1432466257,"1":1640086789}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.452Z"}

They include about 650 species of herbs, shrubs, and trees in 17 genera. The family is widespread, occurring on every continent from boreal to tropical regions.\n\nThe family includes a number of popular garden plants, including evening primroses (Oenothera) and fuchsias (Fuchsia). Some, particularly the willowherbs (Epilobium), are common weeds in gardens and rapidly colonize disturbed habitats in the wild. One such species is fireweed (Chamaenerion angustifolium).\n\nThe family is characterised by flowers with usually four sepals and petals; in some genera, such as Fuchsia, the sepals are as brightly coloured as the petals.\n\nThe seeds are generally very small. In some genera, such as Epilobium, they have tufts of hairs and are dispersed on the wind. In others, such as Fuchsia, the seeds develop in juicy berries dispersed by animals. The leaves are commonly opposite or whorled, but are spirally arranged in some species; in most, they are simple and lanceolate in shape. The pollen grains in many genera are loosely held together by viscin threads. Most bees cannot collect it, and only bees with specialized morphologies can effectively pollinate the flowers; nearly all bee taxa that visit the flowers are oligoleges specialized on the family Onagraceae.\n\nThe family was named after the genus Onagra (now known as Oenothera) in 1836 by John Lindley in the second edition of A Natural System of Botany.","dates":{"added":1688880096,"dateRange":{"0":1245794924,"1":1688820526}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.452Z","category":"folder","title":"Кипрейные - Onagraceae"},{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Combretaceae","deepCounters":{"total":10,"images":7,"folders":3,"files":7},"counters":{"total":3,"folders":3},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B1%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Combretaceae\/%D0%9A%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%20%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B8%20-%20Quisqualis%20indica\/thumbs\/DSC05225.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Комбретовые - Combretaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Combretaceae are a family of flowering plants in the order Myrtales.

The APG III system of classification for angiosperms still places it within the eurosids. The following families are included as of APG III:\nThe Cronquist system gives essentially the same composition, except the Vochysiaceae are removed to the order Polygalales, and the Thymelaeaceae are included. The families Sonneratiaceae, Trapaceae, and Punicaceae are removed from the Lythraceae. In the classification system of Dahlgren the Myrtales were in the superorder Myrtiflorae (also called Myrtanae). The APG III system agrees with the older Cronquist circumscriptions of treating Psiloxylaceae and Heteropyxidaceae within Myrtaceae, and Memecyclaceae within Melastomataceae.\nEllagitannins are reported in dicotyledoneous angiospermes, and notably in species in the order Myrtales.\nMyrtales is dated to have begun 89\u201399 million years ago (mya) in Australasia. There is some contention as to that date however, which was obtained using nuclear DNA. When looking at chloroplast DNA, the myrtales ancestor is instead considered to have evolved in the mid-Cretaceous period (100 mya) in Southeast Africa, rather than in Australasia. Although the APG system classifies myrtales as within the eurosids, the recently published genome of Eucalyptus grandis places the order myrtales as a sister to the eurosids rather than inside them. The discrepancy is thought to have arisen due to the difference between using a large number of taxa versus using a large number of genes for constructing a phylogeny.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1135731404,"1":1703250072}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.935Z"}

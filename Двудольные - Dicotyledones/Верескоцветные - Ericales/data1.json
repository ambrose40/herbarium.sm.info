Saurauia, with its 300 species, is the largest genus in this family. Although now confined to Asia and tropical Central and South America, evidence indicates in the past the family had a wider distribution. The now extinct genus Parasaurauia is thought to have belonged to the Actinidiaceae and lived in North America during the early Campanian.\nThe plants are usually small trees or shrubs, or sometimes vines (Actinidia). The alternate, simple, spiral leaves have serrated or entire margins. They lack stipules or are minutely stipulated. They are often beset with rather flattened bristles.\nThe flowers grow solitary or are aggregated in terminal cymes, with free sepals and petals. Except for members of the genus Clematoclethra which have 10 stamens, the stamens are numerous and originally attached at the back. They invert just before the flower starts expanding, so their bases become apical.\nThe plants may be dioecious, monoecious, or hermaphroditic. The fruit is usually a berry, such as the edible kiwifruit, a cultivar from the genus Actinidia.","dates":{"added":1686441193,"dateRange":{"0":1429957617,"1":1686401359}},"fileDate":"2023-06-11T01:32:41.841Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Balsaminaceae","deepCounters":{"total":87,"images":80,"folders":7,"files":80},"counters":{"total":7,"folders":7},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Balsaminaceae\/%D0%9D%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0%20%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%20-%20Impatiens%20glandulifera%20f.%20purpurea\/thumbs\/DSC04937.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Бальзаминовые - Balsaminaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Balsaminaceae (commonly known as the balsam family) are a family of dicotyledonous plants, comprising two genera: Impatiens, which consists of 1000+&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Бальзаминовые - Balsaminaceae","comment":"The Balsaminaceae (commonly known as the balsam family) are a family of dicotyledonous plants, comprising two genera: Impatiens, which consists of 1000+ species, and Hydrocera, consisting of 1 species.

The family includes about 800 species of evergreen trees and shrubs in around 65 genera (35-75, depending on generic definition). Their distribution is pantropical.\nMany species produce edible fruits, or white blood-sap that is used to cleanse dirt, organically and manually, while others have other economic uses. Species noted for their edible fruits include Manilkara (Sapodilla, sapota), Chrysophyllum cainito (star-apple or golden leaf tree), and Pouteria (abiu, canistel, lúcuma, Mamey sapote). Vitellaria paradoxa (shi in several languages of West Africa and karité in French; also anglicized as shea) is also the source of an oil-rich nut, the source of edible shea butter, which is the major lipid source for many African ethnic groups and is also used in traditional and Western cosmetics and medications. The 'miracle fruit' Synsepalum dulcificum is also in the Sapotaceae.\nTrees of the genus Palaquium (gutta-percha) produce an important latex with a wide variety of uses.\nThe seeds of the tree Argania spinosa produce an edible oil, traditionally harvested in Morocco.\nThe family name is derived from zapote, a Mexican vernacular name for one of the plants (in turn derived from the Nahuatl tzapotl) and Latinised by Linnaeus as sapota, a name now treated as a synonym of Manilkara (also formerly known by the invalid name Achras).","dates":{"added":1396911736,"dateRange":{"0":1356241560,"1":1356243186}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.108Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Sarraceniaceae","deepCounters":{"total":7,"images":5,"folders":2,"files":5},"counters":{"total":2,"folders":2},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Sarraceniaceae\/%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%20%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8E%D1%89%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Heliamphora%20nutans\/thumbs\/DSC09680.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Саррацениевые - Sarraceniaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Sarraceniaceae are a family of pitcher plants, belonging to order Ericales (previously Nepenthales).<br>The family comprises three extant genera: Sarracenia&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Саррацениевые - Sarraceniaceae","comment":"The Sarraceniaceae are a family of pitcher plants, belonging to order Ericales (previously Nepenthales).\nThe family comprises three extant genera: Sarracenia (North American pitcher plants), Darlingtonia (the cobra lily or California pitcher plant), and Heliamphora (sun pitchers). The extinct Archaeamphora longicervia may also belong to this family. All three are carnivorous plants that lure insects with nectar and use their elongated, tube-shaped leaves filled with water and digestive enzymes to catch and consume them. Digestive enzymes are not always produced by the plants themselves. Digestive mutualisms are common in Sarraceniaceae: both Sarracenia and Darlingtonia rely on commensal bacteria to supplement or produce all of their enzymes. Many species also use downward-pointing hairs and waxy secretions to make it difficult for insects to escape.\nSarracenia and Darlingtonia are native to North America, while Heliamphora is native to South America. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the family originated in South America about 47 million years ago and spread to North America soon after, about 35 million years ago. The Sarracenia and Heliamphora clade diverged from Darlingtonia around this time, most likely due to a cooling event at the beginning of the Oligocene. Sarracenia diverged from Heliamphora later, around 23 million years ago.\nThese plants grow in nutrient-poor, often acidic soil and use the insects as a nutritional supplement. As such, growth of carnivorous pitchers is plastic: as soil nitrogen increases, Sarracenia produces fewer pitchers. The pitchers originate from a rhizome and die back during the winter dormancy. Plants of the genus Sarracenia occur mostly in Sphagnum bogs.\nMost Sarraceniaceae have tall, narrow pitchers that are vertical or nearly so. Sarracenia purpurea, however, has short, squat, bulbous pitchers close to the ground, and Sarracenia psittacina has pitchers that grow horizontally.\nThe purple pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) is the official flower of Newfoundland and Labrador.","dates":{"added":1396911736,"dateRange":{"0":1376477534,"1":1376477709}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.124Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8E%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Polemoniaceae","deepCounters":{"total":148,"images":132,"folders":16,"files":132},"counters":{"total":16,"folders":16},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8E%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Polemoniaceae\/%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8E%D1%85%D0%B0%20%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Polemonium%20caeruleum\/thumbs\/DSC08931.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Синюховые - Polemoniaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Polemoniaceae are a family (Jacob's-ladder or phlox family) of about 25 genera with 270-400 species of annual and perennial plants, native to the Northern&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Синюховые - Polemoniaceae","comment":"The Polemoniaceae are a family (Jacob's-ladder or phlox family) of about 25 genera with 270-400 species of annual and perennial plants, native to the Northern Hemisphere and South America, with the center of diversity in western North America, especially in California.\nOnly one genus (Polemonium) is found in Europe, and two (Phlox and Polemonium) in Asia, where they are confined to cool temperate to arctic regions; both genera also occur more widely in North America, suggesting relatively recent colonization of the Old World from North America.\nThe family can be distinguished from most other eudicot families by the ovary made up of three fused carpels (usually with three chambers, but one chamber in some species). The members of the family have five sepals, five petals fused, and five stamens that alternate with the lobes of the corolla.\nFor decades, most sources used a classification of the family published by Grant in 1959, but new evidence, including molecular phylogeny, veins of the corolla, pollen, and the flavonoids present, have led to reclassifications, such as the 1998 classification by Grant. It recognizes two subfamilies. The subfamily Cobaeoideae is tropical\/subtropical and composed of six genera organized into five tribes. The subfamily Polemonioideae consists of 13 temperate genera. Grant divides it into three tribes, but with the disclaimer that it is not clear what the correct division is and that the genus classifications may be more useful in this subfamily.","dates":{"added":1662486693,"dateRange":{"0":1312101092,"1":1662292982}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.139Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%A7%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Theaceae","deepCounters":{"total":51,"images":49,"folders":2,"files":49},"counters":{"total":2,"folders":2},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A7%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Theaceae\/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D1%8F%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Camellia%20japonica\/thumbs\/0DSC01553.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Чайные - Theaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Theaceae is a family of flowering plants, composed of shrubs and trees, including the camellias.

It can be described as having from seven to 40 genera, depending on the source and the method of circumscription used. The family Ternstroemiaceae has been included within Theaceae; however, the APG III system of 2009 places it instead in Pentaphylacaceae.\nPlants in this family are characterized by simple leaves that are alternate spiral to distichial, serrated, and usually glossy. Most of the genera have evergreen foliage, but Stewartia and Franklinia are deciduous. The toothed margins are generally associated with a characteristic Theoid leaf tooth, which is crowned by a glandular, deciduous tip. The flowers in this family are usually pink or white and large and showy, often with a strong scent. The calyx consists of five or more sepals, which are often persistent in the fruiting stage, and the corolla is five-merous, rarely numerous. Plants in Theaceae are multistaminate, usually with 20-100+ stamen either free or adnate to the base of the corolla, and are also distinctive because of the presence of pseudopollen. The pseudopollen is produced from connective cells, and has either rib-like or circular thickenings. The ovary is often hairy and narrows gradually into the style, which may be branched or cleft. The carpels are typically opposite from the petals, or the sepals in the case of Camellia. The fruits are loculicidal capsules, indehiscent baccate fruits or sometimes pome-like. The seeds are few and sometimes winged, or in some generas covered by fleshy tissue or unwinged and nude.","dates":{"added":1709663818,"dateRange":{"0":1390740764,"1":1709300745}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.124Z","category":"folder","title":"Чайные - Theaceae"},{"path":"%D0%AD%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Ebenaceae","deepCounters":{"total":37,"images":36,"folders":1,"files":36},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%AD%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Ebenaceae\/%D0%A5%D1%83%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%20%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Diospyros%20kaki\/thumbs\/IMG_2006.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Эбеновые - Ebenaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Ebenaceae are a family of flowering plants belonging to order Ericales.

The family is most diverse in the rainforests of Malesia, India, tropical Africa and tropical America.\n\nMany species are valued for their wood, particularly ebony, for fruit, and as ornamental plants.","dates":{"added":1422822598,"dateRange":{"0":1419785611,"1":1419800276}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.124Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Верескоцветные - Ericales","comment":"The Ericales are a large and diverse order of dicotyledons, including, for example, tea, persimmon, blueberry, Brazil nut, and azalea. The order includes trees, bushes, lianas, and herbaceous plants. Together with ordinary autophytic plants, the Ericales include chlorophyll-deficient mycoheterotrophic plants (e.g., Sarcodes sanguinea) and carnivorous plants (e.g., genus Sarracenia).\nMany species have five petals, often grown together. Fusion of the petals as a trait was traditionally used to place the order in the subclass Sympetalae.\nMycorrhiza is an interesting property, frequently associated with the Ericales. Indeed, symbiosis with root fungi is quite common among the order representatives, and three kinds of it can be found exclusively among Ericales (namely, ericoid, arbutoid and monotropoid mycorrhiza). In addition, some families among the order are notable for their exceptional ability to accumulate aluminum.\nEricales are a cosmopolitan order. Areas of distribution of families vary largely - while some are restricted to tropics, others exist mainly in Arctic or temperate regions. The entire order contains over 8,000 species, of which the Ericaceae account for 2,000-4,000 species (by various estimates).","dates":{"added":1709663818,"dateRange":{"0":1223233716,"1":1709300745}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.919Z"}

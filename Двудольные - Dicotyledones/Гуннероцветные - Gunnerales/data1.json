Such a family has been recognized by most taxonomists. Gunneraceae consists of the single genus Gunnera with 63 known species.\nThe APG II system, of 2003, also recognizes this family and assigns it to the order Gunnerales in the clade core eudicots. The family then consisted of one or two genera, Gunnera and, optionally, Myrothamnus, the latter optionally segregated as a separate family, Myrothamnaceae. This represents a change from the APG system, of 1998, which firmly recognized two separate families, unplaced as to order. The APG III system and APG IV system recognizes the family Gunneraceae and places Myrothamnus in Myrothamnaceae; both families are placed in the order Gunnerales in the core eudicots.\nGunneraceae are known for its species with mammoth-sized leaves, but many species are much smaller and less impressive than the commonly cultivated 'giant rhubarb' Gunnera manicata, which is not related to the edible rhubarb.","dates":{"added":1653173232,"dateRange":{"0":1652952307,"1":1652952365}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.124Z","category":"folder","title":"Гуннеровые - Gunneraceae"}],"name":"Гуннероцветные - Gunnerales","comment":"The Gunnerales are an order of flowering plants. In the APG III system (2009) and APG IV system (2016) it contains two genera: Gunnera (in family Gunneraceae) and Myrothamnus (in family Myrothamnaceae). In the Cronquist system (1981), the Gunneraceae were in the Haloragales and Myrothamnaceae in the Hamamelidales.DNA analysis was definitive, but the grouping of the two families was a surprise, given their very dissimilar morphologies. In Cronquist's old system (1981, 1988), and Takhtajan's (1997), the Gunneraceae were in the Rosidae, and the Myrothamnaceae were in the Hamamelids. In modern classification systems such as APG III and APG IV this order was the first to derive from the core eudicots.","dates":{"added":1653173232,"dateRange":{"0":1652952307,"1":1652952365}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.919Z","title":"Гуннероцветные - Gunnerales"}

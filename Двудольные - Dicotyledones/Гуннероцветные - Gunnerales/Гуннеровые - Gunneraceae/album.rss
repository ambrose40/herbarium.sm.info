   		<description>Gunneraceae is a family of flowering plants, closely related to Myrothamnaceae, together forming the order Gunnerales. Such a family has been recognized by most taxonomists. Gunneraceae consists of the single genus Gunnera with 63 known species.
The APG II system, of 2003, also recognizes this family and assigns it to the order Gunnerales in the clade core eudicots. The family then consisted of one or two genera, Gunnera and, optionally, Myrothamnus, the latter optionally segregated as a separate family, Myrothamnaceae. This represents a change from the APG system, of 1998, which firmly recognized two separate families, unplaced as to order. The APG III system and APG IV system recognizes the family Gunneraceae and places Myrothamnus in Myrothamnaceae; both families are placed in the order Gunnerales in the core eudicots.
Gunneraceae are known for its species with mammoth-sized leaves, but many species are much smaller and less impressive than the commonly cultivated &apos;giant rhubarb&apos; Gunnera manicata, which is not related to the edible rhubarb.</description>

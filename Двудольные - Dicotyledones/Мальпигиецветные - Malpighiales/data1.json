The hermaphroditic, actinomorphic flowers are pentameric, or very rarely tetrameric (e.g. Radiola linoides, Linum keniense).\nIn the Linoideae, the largest genus is Linum, the flaxes, with 180-200 species including the cultivated flax, Linum usitatissimum. Members of the Linoideae include herbaceous annuals and perennials, as well as woody subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees (Tirpitzia) inhabiting temperate and tropical latitudes of Eurasia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. The largest genus of the Hugonioideae is Hugonia (about 40 species); the Hugonioideae are woody vines, shrubs, and trees, and are almost entirely tropical in distribution. In addition to their growth habits and geographic distributions, the Linoideae and Hugonioideae can be differentiated by the number of fertile stamens (five in the Linoideae, 10 in the Hugonioideae) and fruit type (capsules in the Linoideae, fleshy drupe-like fruits in the Hugonioideae).","dates":{"added":1653173229,"dateRange":{"0":1240935806,"1":1652956638}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.405Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9C%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Euphorbiaceae","deepCounters":{"total":306,"images":278,"folders":28,"files":278},"counters":{"total":28,"folders":28},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9C%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Euphorbiaceae\/%D0%9C%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%B8%20%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Euphorbia%20coerulescens\/thumbs\/0DSC08804.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Молочайные - Euphorbiaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Euphorbiaceae, the spurge family, is a large family of flowering plants.

Ochnaceae is most diverse in the neotropics, with a second center of diversity in tropical Africa. It consists mostly of shrubs and small trees, and, in Sauvagesia, a few herbaceous species. Many are treelets, with a single, erect trunk, but low in height. The Ochnaceae are notable for their unusual leaves. These are usually shiny, with closely spaced, parallel veins, toothed margins, and conspicuous stipules. Most of the species are buzz pollinated.

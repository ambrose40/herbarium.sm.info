It includes trees, shrubs, and perennial or annual herbaceous plants, which are easily recognized by their fruit (legume) and their compound, stipulated leaves. Many legumes have characteristics of flowers and fruits. The family is widely distributed, and is the third-largest land plant family in terms of number of species, behind only the Orchidaceae and Asteraceae, with about 751 genera and some 19,000 known species. The five largest of the genera are Astragalus (over 3,000 species), Acacia (over 1000 species), Indigofera (around 700 species), Crotalaria (around 700 species) and Mimosa (around 500 species), which constitute about a quarter of all legume species. The ca. 19,000 known legume species amount to about 7% of flowering plant species. Fabaceae is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and in dry forests in the Americas and Africa.\nRecent molecular and morphological evidence supports the fact that the Fabaceae is a single monophyletic family. This point of view has been supported not only by the degree of interrelation shown by different groups within the family compared with that found among the Leguminosae and their closest relations, but also by all the recent phylogenetic studies based on DNA sequences. These studies confirm that the Fabaceae are a monophyletic group that is closely related to the Polygalaceae, Surianaceae and Quillajaceae families and that they belong to the order Fabales.\nAlong with the cereals, some fruits and tropical roots, a number of Leguminosae have been a staple human food for millennia and their use is closely related to human evolution.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1223233548,"1":1703250223}},"fileDate":"2023-05-14T21:29:27.977Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Polygalaceae","deepCounters":{"total":33,"images":29,"folders":4,"files":29},"counters":{"total":4,"folders":4},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Polygalaceae\/%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B4%20%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Polygala%20myrtifolia\/thumbs\/DSC06761.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Истодовые - Polygalaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Polygalaceae or the milkwort family are made up of flowering plants in the order Fabales.

Over half of the species are in one genus, Polygala, the milkworts.\nUnder the Cronquist classification system, Polygalaceae were treated in a separate order of their own, Polygalales. Currently, according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, the family belongs in Fabales.","dates":{"added":1640555895,"dateRange":{"0":1304420500,"1":1639906080}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:46.952Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Бобовоцветные - Fabales","comment":"The Fabales are an order of flowering plants included in the rosid group of the eudicots in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II classification system. In the APG II circumscription, this order includes the families Fabaceae or legumes (including the subfamilies Caesalpinioideae, Mimosoideae, and Faboideae), Quillajaceae, Polygalaceae or milkworts (including the families Diclidantheraceae, Moutabeaceae, and Xanthophyllaceae), and Surianaceae. Under the Cronquist system and some other plant classification systems, the order Fabales contains only the family Fabaceae. In the classification system of Dahlgren the Fabales were in the superorder Fabiflorae (also called Fabanae) with three familiese corresponding to the subfamilies of Fabaceae in APG II. The other families treated in the Fabales by the APG II classification were placed in separate orders by Cronquist, the Polygalaceae within its own order, the Polygalales, and the Quillajaceae and Surianaceae within the Rosales.\nThe Fabaceae, as the third-largest plant family in the world, contain most of the diversity of the Fabales, the other families making up a comparatively small portion of the order's diversity. Research in the order is largely focused on the Fabaceae, due in part to its great biological diversity, and to its importance as food plants. The Polygalaceae are fairly well researched among plant families, in part due to the large diversity of the genus Polygala, and other members of the family being food plants for various Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species. While taxonomists using molecular phylogenetic techniques find strong support for the order, questions remain about the morphological relationships of the Quillajaceae and Surianaceae to the rest of the order, due in part to limited research on these families.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1223233548,"1":1703250223}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.919Z"}

In terms of numbers of species, the Asteraceae are rivaled only by the Orchidaceae. (Which of the two families is actually larger is unclear, owing to uncertainty about exactly how many species exist in each family.) Many members have composite flowers in the form of flower heads (capitula or pseudanthia) surrounded by involucral bracts. When viewed from a distance, each capitulum may have the appearance of being a single flower. The name Asteraceae comes from the type genus Aster, from the Greek ἀστήρ, meaning star, and refers to the star-like form of the inflorescence. Compositae is an older (but still valid) name which refers to the fact that the family is one of the few angiosperm families to have composite flowers.\nMost members of Asteraceae are herbaceous, but a significant number are also shrubs, vines, or trees. The family has a worldwide distribution, from the polar regions to the tropics, colonizing a wide variety of habitats. It is most common in the arid and semiarid regions of subtropical and lower temperate latitudes. The Asteraceae may represent as much as 10% of autochthonous flora in many regions of the world.\nAsteraceae is an economically important family, providing products such as cooking oils, lettuce, sunflower seeds, artichokes, sweetening agents, coffee substitutes and herbal teas. Several genera are of horticultural importance, including pot marigold, Calendula officinalis, Echinacea (cone flowers), various daisies, fleabane, chrysanthemums, dahlias, zinnias, and heleniums. Asteraceae are important in herbal medicine, including Grindelia, yarrow, and many others. A number of species are considered invasive, including, most notably in North America, dandelion, which was originally introduced by European settlers who used the young leaves as a salad green.\nThe study of this family is known as synantherology.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1223233546,"1":1702982204}},"fileDate":"2023-12-25T16:13:26.213Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Argophyllaceae","deepCounters":{"total":14,"images":13,"folders":1,"files":13},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Argophyllaceae\/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Corokia%20cotoneaster\/thumbs\/DSC01791.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Аргофилловые - Argophyllaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Argophyllaceae is a family of shrubs or small trees belonging to the order Asterales.

It consists of five genera with over 240 species, most of which are endemic to Australia and New Zealand. Members of Stylidiaceae are typically grass-like herbs or small shrubs and can be perennials or annuals. Most species are free standing or self-supporting, though a few can be climbing or scrambling (Stylidium scandens uses leaf tips recurved into hooks to climb).\nThe pollination mechanisms of Stylidium and Levenhookia are as follows: In Stylidium the floral column, which consists of the fused stamen and style, springs violently from one side (usually under the flower) when triggered. This deposits the pollen on a visiting insect. In Levenhookia, however, the column is immobile, but the hooded labellum is triggered and sheds pollen.\nIn 1981, only about 155 species were known in the family. The current number of species by genus (reported in 2002) is as follows: Forstera - 5, Levenhookia - 10, Oreostylidium - 1, Phyllachne - 4, and Stylidium - 221. These numbers, especially for Stylidium, are changing rapidly as new species are described.\nStylidium rotundifolium appeared in Joseph Banks' Florilegium (plate 173), drawn from a specimen collected at Endeavour River, Australia in 1770.","dates":{"added":1493459974,"dateRange":{"0":1390738978,"1":1493372319}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:46.925Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Астроцветные - Asterales","comment":"Asterales is an order of dicotyledonous flowering plants that includes the large family Asteraceae (or Compositae) known for composite flowers made of florets, and ten families related to the Asteraceae.The order is a cosmopolite (plants found throughout most of the world including desert and frigid zones), and includes mostly herbaceous species, although a small number of trees (such as the giant Lobelia and the giant Senecio) and shrubs are also present.Asterales are organisms that seem to have evolved from one common ancestor. Asterales share characteristics on morphological and biochemical levels. Synapomorphies (a character that is shared by two or more groups through evolutionary development) include the presence in the plants of oligosaccharide inulin, a nutrient storage molecule used instead of starch; and unique stamen morphology. The stamens are usually found around the style, either aggregated densely or fused into a tube, probably an adaptation in association with the plunger (brush; or secondary) pollination that is common among the families of the order, wherein pollen is collected and stored on the length of the pistil.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1223233546,"1":1702982204}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.919Z"}

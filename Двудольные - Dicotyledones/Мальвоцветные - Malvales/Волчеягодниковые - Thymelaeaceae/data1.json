It was established in 1789 by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu.\nThe Thymelaeaceae are in the order Malvales. Except for a sister relationship with Tepuianthaceae, little is known for sure about their relationships with the other families in the order.\nThe family is more diverse in the southern hemisphere than in the northern, with a major concentrations of species in Africa and Australia. The genera are overwhelmingly African \nThe Thymelaeaceae are mostly trees and shrubs, with a few vines and herbaceous plants.\nSeveral genera are of economic importance. Gonystylus (Ramin) is valued for its comparatively soft, easily-worked yellowish wood, but trade in all species in the genus are controlled by CITES. The bark of Edgeworthia and Wikstroemia is used as a component of paper, while Lagetta species are known as lacebark for their lacelike inner bark, which has been used to make clothing and utilitarian objects.\nDaphne is grown for its sweetly scented flowers. Species of Wikstroemia, Daphne, Phaleria, Dais, Pimelea and other genera are grown as ornamentals.\nMany of the species are poisonous if eaten.","dates":{"added":1654427321,"dateRange":{"0":1274009670,"1":1654352368}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.374Z"}

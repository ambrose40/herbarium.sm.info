Well-known members of this family include okra, cotton, cacao and durian. The largest genera in terms of number of species include Hibiscus (300 species), Sterculia (250 species), Dombeya (250 species), Pavonia (200 species) and Sida (200 species).\nThe circumscription of the Malvaceae is controversial. The traditional Malvaceae sensu stricto comprise a very homogeneous and cladistically monophyletic group. Another major circumscription, Malvaceae sensu lato, has been more recently defined on the basis that molecular techniques have shown the commonly recognised families Bombacaceae, Tiliaceae, and Sterculiaceae, which have always been considered closely allied to Malvaceae s.s., are not monophyletic groups. Thus, the Malvaceae can be expanded to include all of these families so as to compose a monophyletic group. Adopting this circumscription, the Malvaceae incorporate a much larger number of genera.","dates":{"added":1688936036,"dateRange":{"0":1221071470,"1":1687705461}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.499Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%91%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Bixaceae","deepCounters":{"total":11,"images":10,"folders":1,"files":10},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%91%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Bixaceae\/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%BC%20%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B8%20-%20Cochlospermum%20regium\/thumbs\/DSC05254.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Биксовые - Bixaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Bixaceae are a family of dicotyledonous plants commonly called the achiote family.

However, newer arrangements move it, with some other families previously in the Violales families, into the Malvales.\nThe Bixaceae include three genera and a total of 25 species, although Cochlospermum is sometimes placed into its own family, Cochlospermaceae. The best-known of the species in this family is the source of annatto, the achiote, which belongs to the type genus of the family.\nAlthough small, this family has the diversity within to include trees, herbs, and shrubs.

It was established in 1789 by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu.\nThe Thymelaeaceae are in the order Malvales. Except for a sister relationship with Tepuianthaceae, little is known for sure about their relationships with the other families in the order.\nThe family is more diverse in the southern hemisphere than in the northern, with a major concentrations of species in Africa and Australia. The genera are overwhelmingly African \nThe Thymelaeaceae are mostly trees and shrubs, with a few vines and herbaceous plants.\nSeveral genera are of economic importance. Gonystylus (Ramin) is valued for its comparatively soft, easily-worked yellowish wood, but trade in all species in the genus are controlled by CITES. The bark of Edgeworthia and Wikstroemia is used as a component of paper, while Lagetta species are known as lacebark for their lacelike inner bark, which has been used to make clothing and utilitarian objects.\nDaphne is grown for its sweetly scented flowers. Species of Wikstroemia, Daphne, Phaleria, Dais, Pimelea and other genera are grown as ornamentals.\nMany of the species are poisonous if eaten.","dates":{"added":1654427321,"dateRange":{"0":1274009670,"1":1654352368}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.374Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Cistaceae","deepCounters":{"total":48,"images":43,"folders":5,"files":43},"counters":{"total":5,"folders":5},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Cistaceae\/%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B8%20-%20Cistus%20creticus\/thumbs\/0DSC02201.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Ладанниковые - Cistaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Cistaceae are a small family of plants (rock-rose or rock rose family) known for their beautiful shrubs, which are profusely covered by flowers at the time&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Ладанниковые - Cistaceae","comment":"The Cistaceae are a small family of plants (rock-rose or rock rose family) known for their beautiful shrubs, which are profusely covered by flowers at the time of blossom. This family consists of about 170(-200) species in nine genera that are not very distinct, distributed primarily in the temperate areas of Europe and the Mediterranean basin, but also found in North America; a limited number of species are found in South America. Most Cistaceae are subshrubs and low shrubs, and some are herbaceous. They prefer dry and sunny habitats. Cistaceae grow well on poor soils, and many of them are cultivated in gardens.\nThey often have showy yellow, pink or white flowers, which are generally short-lived. The flowers are bisexual, regular, solitary or borne in cymes; they usually have five, sometimes three, petals (Lechea). The petals are free, usually crumpled in the bud, and sometimes in the open flower (e. g. Cistus incanus). It has five sepals, the inner three of which are distinctly wider, and the outer two are narrow and sometimes regarded as bracteoles. The sepal arrangement is a characteristic property of the family.\nThe stamens are numerous, of variable length, and sit on a disc; filaments are free. The ovary is superior, usually with three carpels; placentation is parietal, with two or more ovules on each placenta. The fruit is a capsule, usually with five or ten valves (three in Helianthemum). The seeds are small, with a hard, water-impermeable coating, weighing around 1 mg.\nRecently the neotropical tree Pakaraimaea dipterocarpacea is placed here, following APG IV (2016)","dates":{"added":1653173229,"dateRange":{"0":1304761847,"1":1652956539}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:48:47.405Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Мальвоцветные - Malvales","comment":"The Malvales are an order of flowering plants.

An interesting distribution occurs in Madagascar, where three endemic families of Malvales (Sphaerosepalaceae, Sarcolaenaceae and Diegodendraceae) occur.\nMany species of Malvaceae sensu lato are known for their wood, with that of Ochroma (balsa) being known for its lightness, and that of Tilia (lime, linden, or basswood) as a popular wood for carving. Fruit of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) are used as an ingredient for chocolate. Kola nuts (genus Cola) are notable for their high content of caffeine, and in past were commonly used for preparing of various cola drinks. Other well-known members of Malvales in the APG II sense are daphnes, hibiscus, hollyhocks, okra, baobab trees, cotton, and kapok.","dates":{"added":1688936036,"dateRange":{"0":1221071470,"1":1687705461}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:38.935Z"}

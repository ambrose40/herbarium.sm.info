This order used to be known as the Coniferales.\nThe distinguishing characteristic is the reproductive structure known as a cone produced by all Pinales. All of the extant conifers, such as cedar, celery-pine, cypress, fir, juniper, larch, pine, redwood, spruce, and yew, are included here. Some fossil conifers, however, belong to other distinct orders within the division Pinophyta.\nThe yews had been separated into a distinct order of their own (Taxales), but genetic evidence indicates yews are monophyletic with other conifers and they are now included in the Pinales.\nThe families included are the Araucariaceae, Cephalotaxaceae, Cupressaceae, Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae, Sciadopityaceae, and Taxaceae.","dates":{"added":1703514518,"dateRange":{"0":1192386725,"1":1703071930}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:40:23.687Z","category":"folder"}],"dates":{"added":1703514518,"dateRange":{"0":1192386725,"1":1703071930}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:12.125Z","title":"Хвойные - Pinopsida","path":"%D0%A5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Pinopsida","deepCounters":{"total":980,"images":903,"folders":77,"files":903},"name":"Хвоиные - Pinopsida","comment":"The Pinophyta, also known as Coniferophyta or Coniferae, or commonly as conifers, are a division of vascular land plants containing a single class, Pinopsida. They are gymnosperms, cone-bearing seed plants. All extant conifers are perennial woody plants with secondary growth. The great majority are trees, though a few are shrubs. Examples include cedars, Douglas firs, cypresses, firs, junipers, kauri, larches, pines, hemlocks, redwoods, spruces, and yews. As of 1998, the division Pinophyta was estimated to contain eight families, 68 genera, and 629 living species.\nAlthough the total number of species is relatively small, conifers are ecologically important. They are the dominant plants over large areas of land, most notably the taiga of the Northern Hemisphere, but also in similar cool climates in mountains further south. Boreal conifers have many wintertime adaptations. The narrow conical shape of northern conifers, and their downward-drooping limbs, help them shed snow. Many of them seasonally alter their biochemistry to make them more resistant to freezing. While tropical rainforests have more biodiversity and turnover, the immense conifer forests of the world represent the largest terrestrial carbon sink. Conifers are of great economic value for softwood lumber and paper production."}

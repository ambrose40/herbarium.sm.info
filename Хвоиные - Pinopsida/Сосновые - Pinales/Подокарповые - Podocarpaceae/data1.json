It contains 19 genera if Phyllocladus is included and if Manoao and Sundacarpus are recognized.\nThe family is a classic member of the Antarctic flora, with its main centres of diversity in Australasia, particularly New Caledonia, Tasmania, and New Zealand, and to a slightly lesser extent Malesia and South America (primarily in the Andes mountains). Several genera extend north of the equator into Indochina and the Philippines. Podocarpus reaches as far north as southern Japan and southern China in Asia, and Mexico in the Americas, and Nageia into southern China and southern India. Two genera also occur in sub-Saharan Africa, the widespread Podocarpus and the endemic Afrocarpus.\nParasitaxus usta is unique as the only known parasitic gymnosperm. It occurs on New Caledonia, where it is parasitic on another member of the Podocarpaceae, Falcatifolium taxoides.\nThe genus Phyllocladus is sister to Podocarpaceae sensu stricto. It is treated by some botanists in its own family Phyllocladaceae.","dates":{"added":1649437856,"dateRange":{"0":1493630481,"1":1649421020}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:51:16.28Z"}

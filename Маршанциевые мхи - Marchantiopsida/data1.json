The majority of genera are characterized by the presence of (a) special stalked vertical branches called archegoniophores or carocephala, and (b) sterile cells celled elaters inside the sporangium.","dates":{"added":1640555902,"dateRange":{"0":1462287552,"1":1639911767}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:58.265Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Маршанциевые мхи - Marchantiopsida","comment":"Marchantiopsida is a one of three classes within the liverwort phylum Marchantiophyta.","dates":{"added":1640555902,"dateRange":{"0":1462287552,"1":1639911767}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:10.580Z"}

About 113 species are accepted. Cycas circinalis, a species endemic to India was the first cycad species to be described and was the type of the generic name, Cycas. The best-known Cycas species is Cycas revoluta. Cycas is a very ancient genus of trees. The group achieved its maximum diversity in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, when it was distributed almost worldwide. At the end of the Cretaceous, when the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct, so did most of the cycas in the Northern Hemisphere.","dates":{"added":1396911731,"dateRange":{"0":1342784165,"1":1342784183}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:51:04.743Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Zamiaceae","deepCounters":{"total":4,"images":3,"folders":1,"files":3},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Zamiaceae\/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Zamia%20furfuracea\/thumbs\/DSC04767.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Замиевые - Zamiaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Zamiaceae are a family of cycads that are superficially palm or fern-like.

They are divided into two subfamilies with eight genera and about 150 species in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Australia and North and South America.\nThe Zamiaceae, sometimes known as zamiads, are perennial, evergreen, and dioecious. They have subterranean to tall and erect, usually unbranched, cylindrical stems, and stems clad with persistent leaf bases (in Australian genera).\nTheir leaves are simply pinnate, spirally arranged, and interspersed with cataphylls. The leaflets are sometimes dichotomously divided. The leaflets occur with several sub-parallel, dichotomously-branching longitudinal veins; they lack a mid rib. Stomata occur either on both surfaces or undersurface only.\nTheir roots have small secondary roots. The coralloid roots develop at the base of the stem at or below the soil surface.\nMale and female sporophylls are spirally aggregated into determinate cones that grow along the axis. Female sporophylls are simple, appearing peltate, with a barren stipe and an expanded and thickened lamina with 2 (rarely 3 or more) sessile ovules inserted on the inner (axis facing) surface and directed inward. The seeds are angular, with the inner coat hardened and the outer coat fleshy. They are often brightly colored, with 2 cotyledons.\nOne subfamily, the Encephalartoideae, is characterized by spirally arranged sporophylls (rather than spirally orthostichous), non-articulate leaflets and persistent leaf bases. It is represented in Australia, with two genera and 40 species.\nAs with all cycads, members of the Zamiaceae are poisonous, producing poisonous glycosides known as cycasins.","dates":{"added":1396911738,"dateRange":{"0":1356066392,"1":1356066409}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:51:04.743Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Саговниковые - Cycadales","comment":"Cycadales is an order of seed plants that includes all the extant cycads. These plants typically have a stout and woody (ligneous) trunk with a crown of large, hard and stiff, evergreen leaves. They usually have pinnate leaves. The individual plants are either all male or all female (dioecious). Cycads vary in size from having trunks only a few centimeters to several meters tall. They typically grow very slowly and live very long, with some specimens known to be as much as 1,000 years old. Because of the superficial resemblance, they are sometimes confused with and mistaken for palms or ferns, but are only distantly related to either.\n\nCycadales are found across much of the subtropical and tropical parts of the world. They are found in South and Central America (where the greatest diversity occurs), Mexico, the Antilles, southeastern United States, Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia, Japan, China, Southeast Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and southern and tropical Africa, where at least 65 species occur. Some can survive in harsh semidesert climates (xerophytic), others in wet rain forest conditions, and some in both. Some can grow in sand or even on rock, some in oxygen-poor, swampy, bog-like soils rich in organic material, and some in both. Some are able to grow in full sun, some in full shade, and some in both. Some are salt tolerant (halophytes).\n\nCycadales belong to the biological division Cycadophyta along with the fossil order Medullosales. The three extant families of cycadales are Cycadaceae, Stangeriaceae, and Zamiaceae. Though they are a minor component of the plant kingdom today, during the Jurassic period, they were extremely common. They have changed little since the Jurassic, compared to some major evolutionary changes in other plant divisions.\n\nCycads are gymnosperms (naked seeded), meaning their unfertilized seeds are open to the air to be directly fertilized by pollination, as contrasted with angiosperms, which have enclosed seeds with more complex fertilization arrangements. Cycads have very specialized pollinators, usually a specific species of beetle. They have been reported to fix nitrogen in association with a cyanobacterium living in the roots. These blue-green algae produce a neurotoxin called BMAA that is found in the seeds of cycads. This neurotoxin may enter a human food chain as the cycad seeds may be eaten directly as a source of flour by humans or by wild or feral animals such as bats, and humans may eat these animals. It is hypothesized that this is a source of some neurological diseases in humans.","dates":{"added":1396911738,"dateRange":{"0":1342784165,"1":1356066409}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:40:21.421Z"}

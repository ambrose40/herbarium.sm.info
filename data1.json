The name refers to one of the typical characteristics of the group, namely that the seed has two embryonic leaves or cotyledons. There are around 200,000 species within this group. The other group of flowering plants were called monocotyledons or monocots, typically having one cotyledon. Historically, these two groups formed the two divisions of the flowering plants. so they can not divide in two equal parts. Largely from the 1990s onwards, molecular phylogenetic research confirmed what had already been suspected, namely that dicotyledons are not a group made up of all the descendants of a common ancestor (i.e. they are not a monophyletic group). Rather, a number of lineages, such as the magnoliids and groups now collectively known as the basal angiosperms, diverged earlier than the monocots did. The traditional dicots are thus a paraphyletic group. The largest clade of the dicotyledons are known as the eudicots. They are distinguished from all other flowering plants by the structure of their pollen. Other dicotyledons and monocotyledons have monosulcate pollen, or forms derived from it, whereas eudicots have tricolpate pollen, or derived forms, the pollen having three or more pores set in furrows called colpi.","dates":{"added":1703514519,"dateRange":{"0":1115479862,"1":1703339990}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:09.752Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9E%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Monocotyledones","keywords":["однодольные","Liliopsida","Monocotyledones","monocots"],"deepCounters":{"total":6191,"images":5525,"folders":664,"files":5527,"others":2},"counters":{"total":8,"folders":8},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9E%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Monocotyledones\/%D0%9B%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Liliales\/%D0%9B%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Liliaceae\/%D0%9B%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%2C%20%D1%86%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5%20%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B8%20-%20Lilium%20martagon\/thumbs\/DSC01887.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Однодольные - Monocotyledones<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Monocotyledons are flowering plants (angiosperms) whose seeds typically contain only one embryonic leaf, or cotyledon.

They constitute one of the major groups into which the flowering plants have traditionally been divided, the rest of the flowering plants having two cotyledons and therefore classified as dicotyledons, or dicots. However, molecular phylogenetic research has shown that while the monocots form a monophyletic group or clade (comprising all the descendants of a common ancestor), the dicots do not. Monocots have almost always been recognized as a group, but with various taxonomic ranks and under several different names. The APG III system of 2009 recognises a clade called \"monocots\" but does not assign it to a taxonomic rank.\nThe monocots include about 60,000 species. The largest family in this group (and in the flowering plants as a whole) by number of species are the orchids (family Orchidaceae), with more than 20,000 species. About half as many species belong to the true grasses (Poaceae), which are economically the most important family of monocots. In agriculture the majority of the biomass produced comes from monocots. These include not only major grains (rice, wheat, maize, etc.), but also forage grasses, sugar cane, and the bamboos. Other economically important monocot crops include various palms (Arecaceae), bananas and plantains (Musaceae), gingers and their relatives, turmeric and cardamom (Zingiberaceae), asparagus (Asparagaceae), pineapple (Bromeliaceae), water chestnut (Cyperaceae), and leeks, onion and garlic (Amaryllidaceae). Many houseplants are monocot epiphytes. Additionally most of the horticultural bulbs, plants cultivated for their blooms, such as lilies, daffodils, irises, amaryllis, cannas, bluebells and tulips, are monocots.","dates":{"added":1709228408,"dateRange":{"0":1103958720,"1":1703252983}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:10.955Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%A5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Pinopsida","keywords":["хвойные","Pinophyta","Coniferophyta","Coniferae","conifers"],"deepCounters":{"total":980,"images":903,"folders":77,"files":903},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Pinopsida\/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Pinales\/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Pinaceae\/%D0%9F%D0%B8%D1%85%D1%82%D0%B0%20%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F%20-%20Abies%20koreana\/thumbs\/DSC04408.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Хвойные - Pinopsida<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Pinophyta, also known as Coniferophyta or Coniferae, or commonly as conifers, are a division of vascular land plants containing a single class, Pinopsida.&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Хвоиные - Pinopsida","comment":"The Pinophyta, also known as Coniferophyta or Coniferae, or commonly as conifers, are a division of vascular land plants containing a single class, Pinopsida. They are gymnosperms, cone-bearing seed plants. All extant conifers are perennial woody plants with secondary growth. The great majority are trees, though a few are shrubs. Examples include cedars, Douglas firs, cypresses, firs, junipers, kauri, larches, pines, hemlocks, redwoods, spruces, and yews. As of 1998, the division Pinophyta was estimated to contain eight families, 68 genera, and 629 living species.\nAlthough the total number of species is relatively small, conifers are ecologically important. They are the dominant plants over large areas of land, most notably the taiga of the Northern Hemisphere, but also in similar cool climates in mountains further south. Boreal conifers have many wintertime adaptations. The narrow conical shape of northern conifers, and their downward-drooping limbs, help them shed snow. Many of them seasonally alter their biochemistry to make them more resistant to freezing. While tropical rainforests have more biodiversity and turnover, the immense conifer forests of the world represent the largest terrestrial carbon sink. Conifers are of great economic value for softwood lumber and paper production.","dates":{"added":1703514518,"dateRange":{"0":1192386725,"1":1703071930}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:12.125Z","category":"folder","title":"Хвойные - Pinopsida"},{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Ginkgoopsida","deepCounters":{"total":26,"images":22,"folders":4,"files":22},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Ginkgoopsida\/%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Ginkgoales\/%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Ginkgoaceae\/%D0%93%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B3%D0%BE%20%D0%B4%D0%B2%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Ginkgo%20biloba\/thumbs\/0SET08504.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Гинкговые - Ginkgoopsida<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Ginkgoales or Ginkgophyte is a gymnosperm order containing only one extant species: Ginkgo biloba, the ginkgo tree.

They typically have a stout and woody (ligneous) trunk with a crown of large, hard and stiff, evergreen leaves. They usually have pinnate leaves. The individual plants are either all male or all female (dioecious). Cycads vary in size from having trunks only a few centimeters to several meters tall. They typically grow very slowly and live very long, with some specimens known to be as much as 1,000 years old. Because of their superficial resemblance, they are sometimes mistaken for palms or ferns, but they are not closely related to either group.\nCycads are gymnosperms (naked seeded), meaning their unfertilized seeds are open to the air to be directly fertilized by pollination, as contrasted with angiosperms, which have enclosed seeds with more complex fertilization arrangements. Cycads have very specialized pollinators, usually a specific species of beetle. They have been reported to fix nitrogen in association with various cyanobacteria living in the roots (the \"coralloid\" roots). These photosynthetic bacteria produce a neurotoxin called BMAA that is found in the seeds of cycads. This neurotoxin may enter a human food chain as the cycad seeds may be eaten directly as a source of flour by humans or by wild or feral animals such as bats, and humans may eat these animals. It is hypothesized that this is a source of some neurological diseases in humans.","dates":{"added":1396911738,"dateRange":{"0":1342784165,"1":1356066409}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:11.913Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%93%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Gnetopsida","deepCounters":{"total":23,"images":18,"folders":5,"files":18},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%93%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Gnetopsida\/%D0%A5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%2C%20%D0%AD%D1%84%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Ephedrales\/%D0%A5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%2C%20%D0%AD%D1%84%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Ephedraceae\/%D0%A5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%20%D0%B4%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%85%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Ephedra%20distachya\/thumbs\/DSC09178.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Гнетовые - Gnetopsida<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Gnetophyta is a division of plants, grouped within the gymnosperms (which also includes conifers, cycads, and ginkgos), that consists of some 70 species across&hellip;<\/div>","name":"Гнетовые - Gnetopsida","comment":"Gnetophyta is a division of plants, grouped within the gymnosperms (which also includes conifers, cycads, and ginkgos), that consists of some 70 species across the three relict genera: Gnetum (family Gnetaceae), Welwitschia (family Welwitschiaceae), and Ephedra (family Ephedraceae). Fossilized pollen attributed to a close relative of Ephedra has been dated as far back as the Early Cretaceous. Though diverse and dominant in the Tertiary, only three families, each containing a single genus, are still alive today. The primary difference between gnetophytes and other gymnosperms is the presence of vessel elements, a system of conduits that transport water within the plant, similar to those found in flowering plants. Because of this, gnetophytes were once thought to be the closest gymnosperm relatives to flowering plants, but more recent molecular studies have largely disproven this hypothesis.\nThough it is clear they are all closely related, the exact evolutionary inter-relationships between gnetophytes are unclear. Some classifications hold that all three genera should be placed in a single order (Gnetales), while other classifications say they should be distributed among three separate orders, each containing a single family and genus.

Some studies show that Psilotopsida is the sister-group to all other ferns (including Marattiaceae and Equisetaceae), but others indicate that Equisetaceae is more basal.","dates":{"added":1592318091,"dateRange":{"0":1434186779,"1":1590924797}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:11.782Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%A5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Equisetopsida","deepCounters":{"total":97,"images":86,"folders":11,"files":86},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%A5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Equisetopsida\/%D0%A5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Equisetales\/%D0%A5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Equisetaceae\/%D0%A5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%89%20%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Equisetum%20fluviatile\/thumbs\/DSC02376.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Хвощёвые - Equisetopsida<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Equisetopsida, or Sphenopsida, is a class of vascular plants with a fossil record going back to the Devonian.

They are commonly known as horsetails. Living horsetails are represented by about twenty herbaceous species in the single genus Equisetum. They typically grow in wet areas, with whorls of needle-like branches radiating at regular intervals from a single vertical stem.\nThe Equisetopsida were formerly regarded as a separate division of spore plants and also called Equisetophyta, Arthrophyta or Sphenophyta; today they have been recognized as rather close relatives of the typical ferns (Pteridopsida) and form a specialized lineage of the Pteridophyta. However, the division between the Equisetopsids and the ferns is so ancient that many botanists, especially paleobotanists, still regard this group as fundamentally separate at the higher level.","dates":{"added":1652035499,"dateRange":{"0":1241730770,"1":1652019654}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:12.202Z","category":"folder","title":"Хвощёвые - Equisetopsida"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Lycopodiopsida","deepCounters":{"total":27,"images":22,"folders":5,"files":22},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Lycopodiopsida\/%D0%9F%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Lycopodiales\/%D0%9F%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Lycopodiaceae\/%D0%9F%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%BD%20%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Lycopodium%20annotinum\/thumbs\/DSC03717.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Плауновые - Lycopodiopsida<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Lycopodiopsida is a class of herbaceous vascular plants known as the clubmosses and firmosses.

They have dichotomously branching stems bearing simple leaves without ligules and reproduce by means of spores borne in sporangia at the bases of the leaves. Traditionally, the group also included the spikemosses (Selaginella and relatives) and the quillworts (Isoetes and relatives) but because these groups have leaves with ligules and reproduce using spores of two different sizes both are now placed into another class, Isoetopsida that also includes the extinct Lepidodendrales. These groups, together with the horsetails are often referred to informally as fern allies.\nThe class Lycopodiopsida as interpreted here contains a single living order, the Lycopodiales, and a single extinct order, the Drepanophycales.","dates":{"added":1664462319,"dateRange":{"0":1313843676,"1":1663850420}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:11.377Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%88%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Isoetopsida","deepCounters":{"total":9,"images":6,"folders":3,"files":6},"counters":{"total":1,"folders":1},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%88%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Isoetopsida\/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Selaginellales\/%D0%9F%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Selaginellaceae\/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D0%B0%20%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%20-%20Selaginella%20willdenowii\/thumbs\/DSC06767.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Полушниковые - Isoëtopsida<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">The Isoetopsida is a class of Lycopodiophyta.

'snake-tongue ') are a small group of pteridophyte plants. Traditionally they are included in the division Pteridophyta, the ferns, originally as a family and later as the order Ophioglossales. In some classifications this group is placed in a separate division, the Ophioglossophyta, but recent molecular systematic studies have shown the Ophioglossales to be closely related to the Psilotales.\n\nIn the molecular phylogenetic classification of Smith et al. in 2006, Ophioglossales, in its present circumscription, was placed with the order Psilotales in the class Psilotopsida. The linear sequence of Christenhusz et al. (2011), intended for compatibility with the classification of Chase and Reveal (2009) which placed all land plants in Equisetopsida, made it a member of subclass Ophioglossidae, equivalent to Smith's Psilotopsida. The placement of Ophioglossales in subclass Ophioglossidae has subsequently been followed in the classifications of Christenhusz and Chase (2014) and PPG I (2016).\n\nOlder treatments have recognized segregate families within Ophioglossales such as Botrychiaceae for the moonworts and grape ferns and Helminthostachyaceae for Helminthostachys, but all modern treatments combine all members of the order into the single family Ophioglossaceae.\n\nThe plants have short-lived spores formed in sporangia lacking an annulus, and borne on a stalk that splits from the leaf blade; and fleshy roots. Many species only send up one frond or leaf-blade per year. A few species send up the fertile spikes only, without any conventional leaf-blade. The gametophytes are subterranean. The spores will not germinate if exposed to sunlight, and the gametophyte can live some two decades without forming a sporophyte.\n\nThe genus Ophioglossum has the highest chromosome counts of any known plant. The record holder is Ophioglossum reticulatum, with about 630 pairs of chromosomes (1260 chromosomes per cell).","dates":{"added":1592318091,"dateRange":{"0":1434186779,"1":1590924797}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:40:19.517Z","category":"folder"}],"name":"Псилотовые - Psilotopsida","comment":"Psilotopsida is a class of ferns or fern-like plants, considered to be one of the three classes of eusporangiate ferns. It should not be confused with the obsolete class Psilophytopsida. As circumscribed by Smith et al., 2006, Psilotopsida contains two families, Psilotaceae and Ophioglossaceae, placed in orders Psilotales and Ophioglossales, respectively. The affinities of these two groups have long been unclear and a close relationship between them has only recently been confirmed through molecular systematic studies. Some studies show that Psilotopsida is the sister-group to all other ferns (including Marattiaceae and Equisetaceae), but others indicate that Equisetaceae is more basal.","dates":{"added":1592318091,"dateRange":{"0":1434186779,"1":1590924797}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:39:11.782Z"}

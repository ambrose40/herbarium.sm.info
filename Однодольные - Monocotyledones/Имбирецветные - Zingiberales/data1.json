It belongs to the order Zingiberales, which contains horticulturally and economically important plants such as the banana (Musaceae), bird-of-paradise (Strelitziaceae), and edible ginger (Zingiberaceae). The seven genera in Costaceae together contain about 143 known species (1 in Monocostus, 2 in Dimerocostus, 16 in Tapeinochilos, 2 in Paracostus, c. 8 in Chamaecostus, c. 5 in Hellenia, and c. 80 in Costus). They are native to tropical climates of Asia, Africa, Central America, and South America. Several species are frequently found in cultivation.\nThe simple leaves are entire and spirally arranged, with those toward the base of the stem usually bladeless. Leaf bases have a closed sheath with a ligule, or projection at the top of the sheath.\nCostaceae is different from the other families of Zingiberales in that its species have 5 fused staminodes, rather than 2 or 3, and the Costaceae contain no aromatic oils. The fused infertile stamens form a large petaloid labellum that often functions to attract pollinators. The flowers are solitary in Monocostus. In the other genera, the flowers are borne in a terminal spike that ranges from elongate to nearly capitate. Each flower is subtended by a large bract. The fruit is a berry or capsule. The rhizome is fleshy with tuberous roots.","dates":{"added":1640555900,"dateRange":{"0":1355975275,"1":1640167652}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:50:09.328Z","category":"folder"},{"path":"%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Musaceae","deepCounters":{"total":44,"images":41,"folders":3,"files":41},"counters":{"total":3,"folders":3},"thumb":{"path":"%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5%20-%20Musaceae\/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%20%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B8%20-%20Musa%20acuminata\/thumbs\/DSC05089.webp","width":512,"height":410},"thumbCaption":"<h3>Банановые - Musaceae<\/h3><div class=\"comment\">Musaceae is a family of flowering plants composed of three genera with ca 91 known species, placed in the order Zingiberales.

Combined morphological and DNA phylogenetic analyses indicate the family originated in Africa, although this is not the center of its extant diversity.\nThe plants usually have underground rhizomes or tubers. The leaves are arranged in two rows with the petioles having a sheathing base. The leaf blade is narrow or broad with pinnate veins running parallel to the midrib. The petiole may be winged, and swollen into a pulvinus at the base. The inflorescence is a spike or panicle, enclosed by spathe-like bracts. The flowers are small and often inconspicuous, irregular, and bisexual, usually with an outer three free sepals and an inner series of three petaloid-like segments, tube-like in appearance. The fruit is either fleshy or a loculicidal capsule.\nThe APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, 1998), also recognizes this family, and assigns it to the order Zingiberales in the clade commelinids in the monocots. The Marantaceae are considered the most derived family in this group due to the extreme reduction in both stamens and carpels.\nThe family consists of 29 genera with about 570 known species, found in the tropical areas of the world except in Australia.

The order includes 68 genera and 2,600 species. Zingiberales are a unique though morphologically diverse order that has been widely recognised as such over a long period of time. Usually large herbaceous plants with rhizomatous root systems and lacking an aerial stem except when flowering. Flowers are usually large and showy, and the stamens are often modified (staminodes) to also form colourful petal-like structures that attract pollinators.\nZingiberales contain eight families that are informally considered as two groups, differing in the number of fertile stamens. A \"banana group\" of four families appeared first and were named on the basis of large banana like leaves. Later, a more genetically coherent (monophyletic) \"ginger group\" appeared, consisting of the remaining four families. The order, which has a fossil record, is thought to have originated in the early Cretaceous period between 80 and 120 million years ago (Mya), most likely in Australia, and diverged relatively rapidly with the families as we know them today established by the end of the period (66 Mya). Zingiberales are found throughout the tropics (pantropical) with some extension into subtropical and temperate climates. They rely on insects for pollination, together with some birds and small animals.\nThe order includes many familiar plants, and are used as ornamental plants (Bird of Paradise flower, heliconias, prayer-plants), food crops (bananas, plantains, arrowroot), spices and traditional medicines (ginger, cardamom, turmeric, galangal and myoga).","dates":{"added":1661691516,"dateRange":{"0":1135395932,"1":1661605211}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:40:03.440Z"}

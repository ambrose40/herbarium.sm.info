One species of Luzuriaga occurs in New Zealand, and the genus Drymophila is endemic to south-eastern Australia.\nThe genus Alstroemeria, commonly called the Peruvian lilies, are popular florist's and garden flowers. The genus Bomarea is a vine that produces clusters of variously-colored, bell-shaped flowers.\nThe APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), treats the family in the order Liliales, in the clade monocots. The APG III system, of 2009, merged the obscure family Luzuriagaceae into the Alstroemeriaceae, since the former group included only two genera, was the sister group of the Alstroemeriaceae, and possessed the same distinctive twisted petioles.","dates":{"added":1505146958,"dateRange":{"0":1500209618,"1":1500209645}},"fileDate":"2023-04-23T11:54:57.587Z","title":"Альстрёмериевые - Alstroemeriaceae"}

The family counts a single species, Butomus umbellatus.\n\nAt the ranks of family and order, this is the same placement as in the Cronquist system. However, Cronquist assumed a much smaller order and assigned the order to subclass Alismatidae, in class Liliopsida [=monocotyledons].","dates":{"added":1396911738,"dateRange":{"0":1311592483,"1":1311593214}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:50:09.438Z"}

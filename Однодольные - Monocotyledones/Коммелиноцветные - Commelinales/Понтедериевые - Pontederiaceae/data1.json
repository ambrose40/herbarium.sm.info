It is a small family of heterostylous aquatic plants, occurring in tropical and subtropical waters. Charles Darwin was interested in the specialized form of heterostyly found in the family, known as tristyly. Not all of the species are heterostylous. The family contains six genera with a total of 34 known species.\nIt is best known for the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), which is an invasive species in many waterways. The highly modified Hydrothrix gardneri is a submerged aquatic with a two-flowered pseudanthium.","dates":{"added":1396911738,"dateRange":{"0":1356337066,"1":1356337236}},"fileDate":"2023-01-20T17:50:09.328Z"}
